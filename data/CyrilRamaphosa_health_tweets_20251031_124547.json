    "text": "Honourable Members,\nÂ \nIt is vital that the National Council on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide is established with the authority and resources outlined in the Act. \nÂ \nThe interim allocation of R5 million for the secretariat is a transitional measure, enabling the coordination of the implementation of the National Strategic Plan against GBVF.\nÂ \nTo ensure that the National Council is able to fulfil its critical functions, National Treasury has approved the Council as a separate sub programme with ring-fenced funds from 1 April 2026.\nÂ \nThe Council is planned for establishment from 1 April 2026, following due processes.\nÂ \nMinisters have nominated government representatives to the Council and the relevant Portfolio Committee in the National Assembly will call for civil society and private sector nominations. \nÂ \nThe Board will appoint the CEO and secretariat staff.\nÂ \nDraft Regulations to coordinate provincial and local GBVF structures are being developed.\nÂ \nThe strength of the National Strategic Plan lies in mobilising multiple stakeholders and mainstreaming this work across government. \nÂ \nEvery government department and entity is expected to contribute to the implementation of the National Strategic Plan within its mandate, while the National Council provides leadership and oversight.\nÂ \nAll relevent government departments have dedicated funds towards the implementation of those pillars of the National Strategic Plan that fall within their respective areas of responsibility.\nÂ \nWhile the work to establish the National Council is underway, the implementation of the NSP is proceeding. \nÂ \nFor example, the GBVF Natjoints established in April has strengthened government-wide coordination.\nÂ \nAwareness campaigns, school and university interventions are ongoing.\nÂ \nSexual Offences Courts, Thuthuzela Care Centres and GBV desks are operational nationwide.\nÂ \nPsychosocial support and integrated services are provided through the Department of Social Development, Khuseleka One-Stop Centres and the GBV Command Centre.\nÂ \nThere is also progress with economic empowerment initiatives, mainly through improving the access of women-owned businesses to procurement opportunities in both government and the private sector.\nÂ \nThese initiatives show that the National Strategic Plan is a living framework. \nÂ \nThe National Council is expected, once operational, toaccelerate this progress through stronger oversight, coordination and accountability.\nÂ \nGender-based violence and femicide is a stain on the conscience of our nation. \nÂ \nThe National Council is an important instrument in strengthening our response to this epidemic, ensuring that all South Africans are mobilised to ensure that is brought to an end.\n\n#RamaphosaQandA",
