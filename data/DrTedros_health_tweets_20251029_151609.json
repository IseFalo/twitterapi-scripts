Forty-nine of these attacks occurred this year alone, killing 966 people.\n\nAll attacks on health care MUST STOP immediately and unconditionally.\n\nAll patients, health personnel and health facilities must be protected under International Humanitarian Law. \n\nCeasefire!",

So far, we have:\n-Deployed an emergency medical team within 24h to boost surgical and emergency care at Al-Ahli Hospital, with more deployments planned in Gaza City as people begin to return.\n-Brought 8 trucks of medical supplies into Gaza, including insulin, lab supplies, and essential medicines.\n-Reached European Gaza Hospital to retrieve cancer and other life-saving medications and intensive care unit equipment, including incubators, mechanical ventilators, and patient monitors. Equipment and medicines were transferred to Nasser Hospital.\n\nImprovement in access to health facilities and the ability to expand our missions are crucial first steps in providing immediate health support to Palestinians across Gaza. \n\nThe beginning of the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees brings hope for all those who have suffered over the past two years.\n\nThis week’s developments mark an important step in the right direction. We are ready to substantially expand our work to save lives and restore health services.\n\nGaza’s health system must be rehabilitated and rebuilt. This crisis gives us the opportunity to rebuild it better: stronger, fairer and centered on people’s needs.\n\nThe best medicine is peace.",

It is built in communities — by people who care, who organize, and who act.\n\nThis is the approach that all @WHOSEARO countries are following, with strong focus on:\n1. Equity — reaching those who are hardest to reach, and addressing the social and economic barriers that keep people from care.\n2. Health systems transformation through primary health care, digital innovation, and sustainable financing.\n3. Integration of traditional and complementary medicine into national systems, and commitment to community-driven health promotion.\n\nMy three asks to the Ministers at the #RC78:\n-To engage actively in negotiations on the PABS annex to the #PandemicAccord, and to conclude it in time for next year’s World Health Assembly in May.\n-To generate financing for health, and improve efficiency, as they build a more self-reliant future, free from aid dependency.\n-To work with us to build a stronger, more empowered and more independent @WHO, that is better able to serve all countries.\n\nTogether, for #HealthForAll!",

    "text": "It is with deep gratitude, pride and humility that I accepted the Elisabeth B. Weintz Humanitarian Award, from the @Harvard Humanitarian Initiative - @HHI, at @HarvardChanSPH today.\n\nI received it on behalf of the incredible women and men I am proud to call my @WHO colleagues. As we speak, some of them are in:\n- Gaza, providing lifesaving care;\n- the DRC, responding to that country’s latest outbreak of Ebola;\n- Sudan, vaccinating against a cholera outbreak spurred by years of civil war;\n- 150 different countries across 6 regions and headquarters, supporting governments in the sometimes slow and unglamorous work of strengthening health systems.\n\nIt’s sometimes easy to despair about the state of our world. \n\nBut when I meet my colleagues, I take heart, and I take hope.\n\nI share my heartfelt thanks to the Weintz family, especially Elizabeth’s son Eric.\n\nTo join the ranks of Nobel laureates, peacebuilders and activists who’ve received this award is humbling. \n\nEach has shown moral courage in the face of injustice. Each has demonstrated outstanding leadership.\n\nEach has given voice to those who have none; and most importantly, each has made a difference.",

But for immunocompromised patients, particularly those with uncontrolled HIV, the risk remains high.\n\nWe are seeing increasing capacity in countries to manage mpox outbreaks.\n\nThe declaration of the public health emergency a year ago brought much-needed resources for controlling these outbreaks.\n\nBut drastic cuts to foreign assistance are hindering our efforts. They are impacting access to vaccines and diagnostics, and full implementation of public health measures.\n\nWe call on all countries to remain vigilant and prioritise bringing outbreaks under control.

We regret the US decision to reject the amendments adopted by consensus by the World Health Assembly in 2024 — including by the US, as the US played an active role in developing and negotiating those amendments together with other countries.\n \nHence, I wish to correct inaccuracies stated by @SecKennedy and @SecRubio:\n- the 2024 amendments were proposed, negotiated and adopted by Member States, based on the learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic; \n- ⁠the 2024 amendments are not about empowering WHO, but about improving cooperation among Member States in the next pandemic; \n- the 2024 amendments are clear about Member States sovereignty. WHO has never had the power to mandate lockdowns, travel restrictions or other such measures - Member States have the power to do so if they see the need. \n- risk communication is an essential part of any emergency response, as populations need to be informed in a timely way. Using disease outbreaks for propaganda would be destructive and disastrous;\n- WHO is impartial and works with all countries to improve people’s health. Here is the timeline of the WHO COVID-19 response: https://t.co/rs4vEo7QGF\n\nLike the US, WHO would like to see better and stronger cooperation among countries in tackling current and future health threats. The world’s nations came together to create such a system when they created WHO, and they continue to support this system.",

Challenges and Importance of Multilateralism — The adoption of the #PandemicAgreement is a clear indication that multilateralism is alive and well.\n\n2. Cuts to Official Development Assistance — Moving forward, it is essential for countries to mobilize domestic resources and promote self-reliance to achieve #HealthForAll.\n\n3. AI and Other Digital Tools — The future of health services is digital, so investing in AI and other digital tools is vital. It is crucial that these tools are used safely, ethically, and equitably.\n\nBy working together through multilateralism, we can create a healthier, safer, and fairer world.",
