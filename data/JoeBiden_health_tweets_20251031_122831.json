    "text": "Fifteen years ago today, I stood with President Obama as he signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It was a big deal then and it still is today.\n\nUnder my administration, we focused on building on the successes of the ACA. I’m proud that we helped a record number of Americans sign up for marketplace coverage and significantly lowered the costs of prescription drugs and premiums.\n\nI believe that health care is a right, not a privilege – and we should always protect it.",
