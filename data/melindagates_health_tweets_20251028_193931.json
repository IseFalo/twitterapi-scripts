I’ve seen so many powerful examples of what that impact looks like: A child receiving a lifesaving vaccine. A woman being able to decide if and when to become pregnant. Farmers breaking their families out of poverty thanks to more productive harvests. These stories behind the statistics will have effects that ripple across generations, and I know the next twenty years will unlock many more. \nhttps://t.co/dUy9UxAgXj",

Now the U.S. government is reportedly planning to end its support for Gavi—support that’s been critical to this progress for nearly 25 years.\n\nIt breaks my heart to think that more than a million children in low-income countries could die over the next five years because of this decision.\n\nIt’s no exaggeration to say that the world’s success in immunizing children is one of the greatest achievements in history. It’s also one of the hardest-won. Mothers around the world line up for hours in the heat to get vaccines for their children, women travel through mountains on foot to administer them, and thousands of scientists dedicate their lives to developing them—all because there’s nothing more important than saving the life of a child.\n\nLeaders must reconsider the plan to end support for Gavi. Unraveling one of the most effective systems in global health would be an absolutely devastating choice.",

I knew him best as a global health advocate and deeply admired his dedication to taking on diseases that impact the world’s poorest people, like Guinea worm disease. \n\nWhen President Carter left office, there were more than 3.5 million cases of this painful, debilitating disease around the world each year. This year, thanks in no small part to the work of the Carter Center, that number was down to single digits. He dreamed of outliving the last Guinea worm—and came incredibly close.\n\nAs he traveled around the world meeting with heads of state, monitoring elections, visiting clinics, and building homes, he took time to connect to the people he met. He believed in removing the barriers that separated a man like him—a former President and Nobel Prize winner—from people living with the realities of poverty and disease.\n\nOne of my favorite teachings says: “To know that even one life has breathed easier because you lived, this is to have succeeded.” We honor President Carter by remembering that because of him, life is healthier, better, and safer not just for one life, but for millions.",

A leader who understands that supporting caregivers leads to healthier families and a stronger economy. A leader who knows that when women have their full power in society, we all thrive.\n\nI am supporting Vice President Kamala Harris because she is that leader. She has an inspiring vision for America—and she has the experience to make it a reality. The issues she prioritizes are the ones that matter to voters. She has been crisscrossing the country to make the case for reproductive rights while courts and state legislatures are trying to take them away. She spearheaded legislation to eliminate racial disparities in maternal health care. She is leading on policies to make paid leave, child care, and elder care more affordable for families.\n\nI am proud to support Vice President Harris. During her years in the White House, she has proven that she knows how to lead through crises while pushing for the change we need. I want her fighting for our country for the next four years.",
