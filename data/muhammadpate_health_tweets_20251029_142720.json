    "text": "In furtherance of His Excellency President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, @officialABAT, Renewed Hope Agenda, and in line with our national commitment to achieving Universal Health Coverage (#UHC), I am pleased to provide an update on Nigeria’s progress in expanding access to quality and affordable health insurance.\n\nOut-of-pocket payments remain the dominant source of health care expenditure for most of our people, translating into higher costs and lower standards of accountability for providers. When the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare @Fmohnigeria signed the Renewed Hope Ministerial Performance Monitoring Bond with its detailed key performance indicators, we set ambitious 2030 targets that are now within reach, one of which is national health insurance coverage.\n\nUnder the leadership of Mr President, all macroeconomic reform and cross-sectoral policy direction are driven by one objective: ensuring that every Nigerian can actualize their aspirations while accessing affordable, quality care. This people-centred approach defines the comprehensive reforms now reshaping our health sector.\n\nAs we modernize infrastructure across primary, secondary, and tertiary facilities in all local government areas, our record-breaking progress in national health insurance enrollment is aligning demand with Nigeria’s rapidly expanding supply of human resources and infrastructure.\n\nNearly 120,000 health workers have been trained since 2023, and 2,500 doctors, nurses, midwives, and community health extension workers have been recruited to strengthen frontline services. Over the past 16 months, 4,000 health personnel have also been added in Federal Tertiary Hospitals to close workforce gaps.\n\nIn 2024, Nigeria broke its enrollment record with more than 2.4m new people insured, bringing total coverage to about 20m Nigerians. With new policy tools in motion, we are on course to reach 44m by 2030. This is the surest path to reducing out-of-pocket expenditure, which still represents about 70% of total health spending.\n\nSocial health insurance schemes now account for 90% of all enrollments nationwide. A major constraint in care quality has been the low capitation fee for enrollees. For years, the capitation stood at ₦750 per person. We have doubled it to ₦1,450 to ensure providers are properly equipped to deliver consistent, high-quality care. Fee-for-service rates have also been increased by 380%, based on actuarial evidence aligning cost-reflective rates with quality requirements.\n\nThe Federal Government @NigeriaGov has also introduced the One Hour Referral Authorization Code, issued by the insuring entity to the provider to confirm referral approval. By shortening this process to 1 hour, we are eliminating unnecessary delays and ensuring that patients move quickly from primary to specialist care.\n\nTo strengthen accountability, I have directed the National Health Insurance Authority @nhia_nigeria to commence covert mystery shopping to monitor providers and ensure that enrollees are not denied treatment. Undercover monitors are already observing processes in facilities nationwide to ensure that insured Nigerians receive timely and dignified care.\n\nThe evidence is clear. From fewer than 10m hospital visits in all of 2023, more than 46m visits were recorded by the second quarter of 2025. Reforms in the Basic Health Care Provision Fund @TheBHCPF and the NHIA are delivering measurable gains in patient confidence and service utilization.\n\nAs enrollment expands, benefits multiply. Wider adoption of health insurance enhances quality, strengthens accountability, and protects households from financial hardship. These achievements reflect President Tinubu’s vision of a health system that serves all Nigerians, regardless of income or status.\n\nWe will continue to modernize infrastructure, strengthen the workforce, and sustain reforms until every Nigerian is covered and cared for.\n\nThank you, and may God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

    "text": "In line with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s @officialABAT charge for transparency, accountability and efficient use of public and partner resources, the Expanded Ministerial Oversight Committee for the Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) met today to review collective progress in strengthening Nigeria’s health system.\n\nTogether with my colleague, Hon. Minister of State @SalakoIziaq, the Perm Sec @Fmohnigeria, agency heads, State Health Commrs, our partners and civil society, we reflected on the gains made under the NHSRII’s four pillars of governance, efficiency, value-chain optimization and health security.\n\nSince its launch in 2023, the Initiative implemented through a Sector-Wide Approach @SWApGov has aligned federal, state and partner investments around one goal: better health for Nigerians. The BHCPF remains its backbone, supporting essential services through @nhia_nigeria, @NphcdaNG, NEMTC and @NCDCgov, alongside programmes like HOPE PHC, MAMII and IMPACT.\n\nThe results are encouraging. In the first two quarters of 2025, over 80m visits were recorded at primary health facilities, four times more than in 2023. More than 21 million Nigerians are covered under health insurance, over 11,000 pregnant women have received emergency care, 15,000 benefitted from obstetric treatment, and more than 500,000 are enrolled in covered maternal care. Facility data show a 12 percent drop in maternal mortality.\n\nPreventive health outcomes have also improved. The integrated measles, rubella, polio and neglected tropical disease campaign targeting 106 million children has exceeded expectations in the northern states with 92% coverage for measles and rubella and strong results for polio and NTD interventions. These gains reflect the determination of governments, partners and frontline health workers to extend essential services to every community.\n\nWe launched the BHCPF Guideline 2.0, which institutionalizes performance-based financing and accountability and will guide the disbursement of ₦32.9bn to states and facilities before the end of October. Supported facilities will expand from 8,800 to 13,000, with a pathway to 17,000 through the HOPE Programme. Facility allocations have increased from ₦300,750 to between ₦600,000 and ₦800,000 per quarter.\n\nEvidence confirms that BHCPF-supported facilities outperform others across all major service indicators including immunization, skilled birth attendance and service utilization.\n\nTo further safeguard accountability, a JTF with @icpcnigeria has been activated to monitor fund utilization at both facility and community levels, ensuring that public resources directly translate to improved services for Nigerians.\n\nData accuracy and integrity remain central to reform. Instances of overreporting of maternal and child deaths are being addressed through improved verification systems, digital reporting and integration of NINs into health records, enabling the tracking of individual beneficiaries and ensuring that progress remains verifiable and equitable.\n\nThe NEMSAS continues to grow with over 11,000 emergency patients served in the last quarter, disbursing ₦470m for care and operating in 150 LGAs. Nigerians can dial 112 in 30 states, with nationwide coverage expected by December 2025.\n\nTo validate the steady improvements being observed, a Mini-Demographic and Health Survey (Mini-DHS) will be conducted in 2026 to provide independent national data on maternal and child health outcomes and inform future planning. Civil society and the media remain vital partners in sustaining transparency and ensuring that community voices continue to shape implementation. \n\nEqually, we have issued a Red Letter calling on every Nigerian to protect the health of our nation.\n\nUnder the visionary leadership of President Tinubu, Nigeria’s health sector is redefining accountable governance, anchored on results, driven by integrity and inclusion, and turning reforms into real improvements in people’s lives.",

    "text": "The convening of the Summit of the National Nursing and Midwifery and the Presidential High-Level Advisory Council on the Support of Women and Girls in Nigeria today in Abuja underscores a coherent national purpose under the Renewed Hope Agenda of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR @officialABAT, to secure lives, strengthen our health workforce, and advance the dignity and opportunity of women and girls as a foundation of Nigeria’s human capital.\n\nThe launch of the Nigeria Strategic Directions for Nursing and Midwifery (2025–2030) at the Nursing and Midwifery Summit seeks to expand training, elevate leadership, and embed evidence-based professional standards, including our adoption of the Best Practice Spotlight Organization (#BPSO) model, to improve quality of care nationwide. This is a practical step that consolidates service excellence where Nigerians meet their health system: the frontline. In parallel, the Presidential High-Level Advisory Council (P-HLAC) advances an integrated, life-course approach that centres women and girls and recognises that maternal health, adolescent wellbeing, protection from gender-based violence, and equitable access to education and economic opportunity are not peripheral to development; they are the architecture of it.\n\nThese engagements are mutually reinforcing. The Nursing and Midwifery framework strengthens who delivers health while the High-Level Council ensures for whom and how health is delivered and that women and girls can access and benefit from those services safely, equitably, and with dignity. Through the #NHSRII and its Sector-Wide Approach @SWApGov, we are translating collaboration into results: coordinated investments, clear accountability, reliable data, and frontline capacity that reaches every community.\n\nIn tandem, we are advancing the continental mandate entrusted to Mr President as the @_AfricanUnion Champion for Human Resources for Health & Community Health Delivery Partnerships by demonstrating, in practice, how policy coherence, institutional investment, and gender-responsive governance can transform the health workforce and unlock Africa’s demographic dividend. Nigeria will continue to lead by example, scaling training and jobs for nurses and midwives, entrenching evidence-based care, protecting women and girls, and revitalising primary health care as the engine of resilience.\n\nWe deeply appreciate the leadership and partnership across government and society that continue to define our work. We particularly acknowledge the unwavering advocacy and inspiration of Her Excellency, Madam First Lady,  @SenRemiTinubu CON, whose commitment to adolescent health, maternal wellbeing, and women’s empowerment continues to elevate these priorities to national and global attention. Her leadership embodies the human face of the Renewed Hope Agenda.\n\nWe also recognise Her Excellency Senator @HarryBanigo, Chair, Senate Committee on Health @NGRSenate; the Hon Minister Women Affairs @FMWA_ng, Hajiya Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim @ImmaculateIman; and the Hon Minister of Education, @DrTunjiAlausa @NigEducation, whose collaboration with @Fmohnigeria has expanded national training quotas for nurses and midwives from 28,000 to 115,000 and strengthened alignment between health and education in workforce development. The support of the SGF, Senator George Akume @SGFAkume @OfficialOSGF; Hajiya Hadiza Bala Usman @hadizabalausman, SA to the  President, Policy & Coordination and Head, CDCU @NGRPresident; among other colleagues are vital to our mission.\n\nWe appreciate our development partners including the @WHO, @UNFPA, and the @FCDOGovUK, whose consistent technical and programmatic collaboration continues to strengthen the system we are building together under the #NHSRII and the #SWAp framework.\n\nUnder the Renewed Hope Agenda, our direction is clear and our commitment firm, to a health system that protects life, honours those who deliver care, and ensures that no Nigerian is left behind.",

    "text": "The Big Push on Malaria Meeting #BigPush which commenced in Abuja today comes at a pivotal moment for Nigeria and Africa. Malaria remains not only a health emergency but also a profound economic and developmental challenge, accounting for nearly one in three visits to Nigerian health facilities and 90% of the global burden across our continent. Confronting it is therefore central to the transformation of our health system as envisaged by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT, under the Renewed Hope Agenda and the Nigerian Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII).\n\nNigeria has made notable progress in the fight against malaria. Over time, more than 600 million insecticide-treated nets have been distributed nationwide, and recently, new antimalarial vaccines have been piloted in Bayelsa and Kebbi States alongside other significant initiatives. But most of the nets and other treatments continue to be produced abroad, and vaccine uptake has been slower than anticipated. These realities underscore the urgency of strengthening local capacity and embedding malaria action within the broader reforms of NHSRII. Through the sector-wide approach @SWApGov, interventions are being integrated into governance, financing, and delivery reforms thereby ensuring sustainability and maximising impact.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the imminent establishment of a manufacturing hub for long-lasting insecticidal nets #LLIN by the world’s largest producer, here in Nigeria, represents a timely breakthrough. It advances the President’s Healthcare Value Chain agenda @PVAC_NG, reduces dependency, creates jobs, and anchors technology transfer with benefits for Nigeria and the wider region. Equally, the @GlobalFund’s commitment to procure treatments produced in Africa reinforces confidence in local capacity and affirms that Africa must increasingly produce what it consumes.\n\nOur commitment is also reflected in domestic action. Earlier this year, an additional $200 million was mobilised at short notice for HIV, TB, and malaria commodities — a clear signal of political will. This reflects a growing national consensus, spanning parliamentarians, the executive, states, and partners, that health must matter.\n\nAt the same time, Nigeria is embedding health-promoting fiscal reforms in national tax policy to incentivise greater investment in health. Within the NHSRII, malaria is not treated as a vertical programme but as part of system-wide reforms that strengthen governance, expand financing, and reinforce service delivery. In this way, malaria action becomes a catalyst for broader health system transformation.\n\nThe challenges remain considerable. Climate change, drug and insecticide resistance, and population pressures require urgent and sustained responses. Nigeria is therefore scaling community case management, investing in digital surveillance and stronger supply chains, and optimising proven interventions such as nets, preventive therapies, and diagnostics, while layering innovation on top to accelerate progress.\n\nWe acknowledge the coalition of partners including @ALMA_2030, the RBM Partnership @endmalaria, civil society, development partners, and the private sector. Their contributions are vital, but malaria is fundamentally our problem, and Africa must lead. Support from others is welcome, but it must complement African leadership. In this spirit, Nigeria values lessons from Cape Verde and Burkina Faso, and welcomes the engagement of the @_AfricanUnion and @AfricaCDC in shaping a continental response.\n\nIf we do not act decisively by mobilising resources, crowding in investments, and delivering results, we risk repeating this same conversation year after year. Nigeria is determined to chart a different course. Under the Renewed Hope Agenda and the NHSRII, we are leading by example, while calling on Africa to align political will, financing, and innovation. Together, let us turn momentum into action and consign malaria to history in our lifetime.",

    "text": "Today at the Prose Warehouse, Idu Industrial Area, Abuja, I was honoured to flag off the distribution of medical equipment and essential drugs to states across Nigeria. This is more than an event; it is a promise kept under the leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT, as we continue to revitalise primary health care (PHC) within the framework of the Renewed Hope Agenda.\n\nTwo years ago, Nigeria set ambitious targets, under the NHSRII, to reposition PHC as the foundation of our health system. That commitment is now taking shape. Through this intervention, all 36 states and the FCT will receive medical equipment and essential medicines, bringing care closer to our people. For too long, PHCs were under-resourced, forcing mothers to travel long distances for delivery, children to miss vaccinations, and communities to lose confidence. That is changing. A woman in a rural community should not fear childbirth, children must access lifesaving vaccines, families must receive malaria treatment, and adults must find care for hypertension and other common illnesses close to home.\n\nPHC revitalisation goes beyond infrastructure. In the past year, 1,295 PHCs have been refurbished and 38 solar-powered to ensure reliability. We are equipping 500 priority facilities with a full complement of 56 types of essential equipment, including autoclaves, delivery beds, ultrasound machines and incubators, funded through over ₦9 billion in federal appropriations and donor support. Alongside this, 80 categories of essential medicines, such as antimicrobials, antimalarials, antihypertensives, uterotonics, insulin and family planning commodities, are being distributed to every local government in Nigeria, representing an investment of more than ₦14 billion. These measures are transforming PHCs from under-utilised buildings into functional centres of care.\n\nWe are equally investing in the workforce that sustains these centres. 69,106 frontline health workers have been trained, with 60,000 provided uniforms and kits in partnership with the Renewed Hope Initiative of the First Lady @SenRemiTinubu. States are also recruiting new staff. Kaduna has added 216 skilled birth attendants and 969 community health workers; Yobe has added 164 and 258 respectively, while other states are advancing recruitment. The MAMII Initiative has enrolled over 411,000 pregnant women across 21 states, with 30,000 receiving antenatal care, 9,000 transport vouchers, and 14,000 emergency obstetric interventions, including more than 4,500 life-saving caesarean sections. Nigerians are beginning to feel reform where it matters most, at the frontlines.\n\nThis progress reflects the sector-wide approach @SWApGov in action, with @NPHCDA, the @nhia_nigeria, regulators, tertiary institutions and state governments working in alignment with the Federal Government under the Compact signed with Mr President. It also demonstrates the leadership of Dr Muyi Aina @Muyi_Aina, whose team has delivered this milestone with commitment and precision.\n\nWe acknowledge the vital support of our partners, including @gavi; the @GlobalFund; @UNICEF; @UNFPA; the @gatesfoundation; and other philanthropic contributors, alongside private sector partners providing warehousing and logistics. Their contributions are reinforcing what is fundamentally a nationally-owned effort.\n\nAccountability remains paramount. Every item distributed is being tracked electronically, with oversight by the @icpcnigeria and relevant agencies to ensure resources reach intended beneficiaries.\n\nOur journey is underway, but much remains to be done. As we flag off this distribution, preparations are already advancing for the Measles Rubella campaign in October, which will reach more than 100 million children under 14 with vaccines and integrated interventions for nutrition and malaria. These efforts are clear evidence that the Renewed Hope Agenda is real and that Nigeria’s health system is regaining the trust of its people.",

    "text": "It was a timely gathering this morning to advance yet another strand of Nigeria’s ongoing health sector transformation, bringing together government, development partners and life sciences leaders to align patient access with the broader reform agenda.\n\nComing on the heels of the National Dialogue on Health Care Financing and the Power for Health Forum, today’s workshop situates access to medicines and technologies within the same reform continuum. It recognizes Nigeria’s five overlapping transitions: political, demographic, economic, epidemiological and technological, and their implications for population health.\n\nUnder the leadership of His Excellency President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT, and anchored in the Renewed Hope Agenda, the Nigerian Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) provides the framework for these reforms. Through a sector wide approach (#SWAp) @SWApGov, we are aligning federal, state and partner investments within a unified platform that strengthens governance and regulation @NafdacAgency, expands insurance coverage toward 50 million Nigerians @nhia_nigeria, and deliberately builds local manufacturing and research ecosystems @NIPRD2. The objective is clear: to create a health system that is resilient, inclusive and future ready.\n\nNigeria’s health facilities, particularly at the primary health care level, serve as the true retail outlets of our health system where citizens engage daily with services and products. Digitization and energy reforms are converging to power and connect these frontline facilities, expanding their functionality and reach. Already, service utilization is rising sharply, with more than 46 million visits recorded in a single quarter this year compared to fewer than 10 million in 2023. This is evidence that reforms are making facilities more functional, trusted and responsive.\n\nWe thank the Gates Foundation @gatesfoundation for leading this charge and for its continued collaboration, as well as partners such as the Global Surgery Foundation @surgfoundation and UNICEF @UNICEF. The role of leading life sciences companies including @pfizer, @Novartis, @AstraZeneca, @GSK, @sanofi, @Roche , Johnson & Johnson @JNJNews, Lilly @EliLillyandCo, Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) and others remains critical to this effort. Our relationship is a shared commitment to co-invest, to digitize supply chains, to strengthen maternal and child health, to expand access to essential medicines and to build the health workforce Nigerians deserve.\n\nThe ongoing reforms in Nigeria are directly aligned with international commitments to universal health coverage, health security and pandemic preparedness. With clear policy direction, an expanding market of 230 million citizens, and reforms already beginning to bear fruit, Nigeria is charting a path that offers improved health outcomes for our people, a peaceful and prosperous future for the country, and a platform for global partners to deliver sustainable, measurable impact. What succeeds here has the potential to shape Africa’s health future.",

By this mandate we are creating a virtuous cycle in which financially protected employees are healthier, more productive, and better able to drive economic growth. Our goal is to reach 44 million Nigerians with health insurance by 2030—the largest insured pool on the continent.\n\nThe Dialogue reviewed concrete progress: expansion of the Vulnerable Groups Fund; free emergency obstetric services; thousands of fistula repairs; subsidies for dialysis; establishment of the Catastrophic Health Insurance Fund in the 2025 budget; and strengthened partnerships in local pharmaceutical and medical manufacturing, among several others. These reforms are already saving lives, protecting households, and strengthening resilience.\n\nWe also addressed persistent gaps: high out-of-pocket spending, uneven insurance coverage, delayed counterpart funding, and accountability and data weaknesses. Lessons from global experience confirm that rapid progress towards universal health coverage requires increasing the public share of financing through economic growth, rising revenues, and deliberate prioritisation of health. Nigeria is on this path, with fiscal reforms reducing the national deficit from 5.4 percent of GDP to 3 percent, raising revenues to 11.5 percent of GDP, and generating surpluses across 34 states. This fiscal space must be applied to health as human infrastructure and a pillar of national security.\n\nNext steps include briefing the National Economic Council on: state domestication of health laws to secure the #BHCPF; deducting counterpart contributions at source to ensure release; periodic FAAC savings allocations for health, school feeding, and social protection; and support for the @nassnigeria bill to raise the BHCPF above one percent of the CRF. Such measures would provide reliable financing for vaccines, essential commodities, and expanded protection for vulnerable groups.\n\nThe Dialogue reaffirmed the role of the private sector and innovation. Impact investing, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships can expand investment in infrastructure, manufacturing, and service delivery. Health taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverages may offer the double benefit of reducing harmful consumption and creating additional fiscal space. NHIA will also continue market-shaping measures to lower costs through pooled procurement and to strengthen local manufacturers.\n\nAccountability and data will remain central. Quarterly performance dialogues with states, the Joint Annual Review #JAR @SWApGov, the Council on Health, and the mini-DHS will guide course corrections and strengthen results. \n\n1/2>>",

    "text": "It was a great honour to represent HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR, @officialABAT today in Accra, Ghana, at the Africa Health Sovereignty Summit, dedicated to advancing a continental health architecture that is resilient, self‑reliant, and globally respected. Convened under the leadership of Ghana’s President, HE John Dramani Mahama @JDMahama, the Summit seeks to place Africa’s voice at the heart of a reimagined global health governance architecture. At its core is “The Accra Initiative,” a bold framework to redefine how nations, institutions, and partners engage with the health and wellbeing of the African people. \n\nOver recent decades, global health has registered undeniable gains: child mortality has halved since 1990, deaths from HIV and AIDS have fallen by more than forty percent since 2000, and more than a billion people live healthier lives through expanded access to water, sanitation, and clean air. Yet these gains are fragile. Reduced donor funding, recurrent pandemics, growing non‑communicable diseases, and a demographic transition that doubles Africa’s population every twenty‑five years expose the limitations of a system that has relied too heavily on external generosity. The task before us in Accra is to establish a new foundation for health sovereignty, one that is authentically African and globally relevant.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this Summit are clear. First, to articulate a continental consensus that health must be seen not merely as a sector but as a driver of human capital, economic productivity, and resilience. Second, to align political leadership, institutions, and financial instruments behind that vision so that Africa is no longer a passive recipient but an active architect of global health governance. Third, to frame a pathway for investment, industrialization, and innovation that secures Africa’s place in shaping solutions for its people and for the wider world.\n\nTo reach these goals, I put forward twelve specific ideas for African leaders and friends of Africa to consider in reasserting health sovereignty for the continent and for other regions with similar realities. These include renewing strategic alliances with Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean to rebalance the inequities of global health governance, and shifting decisively from narrow disease‑specific interventions towards prevention, wellness, and resilient systems rooted in African priorities. They also include a continental charter on health data sovereignty, ensuring that what is generated on African soil is governed by African institutions and applied first to African needs.\n\nHealth sovereignty will also rest on stronger domestic financing, built through innovative resource mobilization and the empowerment of African institutions such as the @AfDB_Group and @afreximbank to design and deploy sustainable financial instruments. Trade and industrialization must be harnessed, using the @AfCFTA to create a continental health market, stimulate local manufacturing, and harmonize regulation. This goes hand in hand with the protection of African intellectual property and indigenous knowledge, the review of biosecurity agreements to guarantee equitable benefits, and the continued consolidation of the @AfricaCDC in its essential mandate.\n\nOther directions include the establishment of a continental health workforce that can be mobilized rapidly in times of crisis, the codification and recognition of our Continent’s diverse knowledge systems, and a structured engagement of the African Diaspora so that its skills, resources, and networks become central to Africa’s health transformation.\n\nThese ideas are not aspirations; they are the foundations of sovereignty, aligned with the @_AfricanUnion Agenda 2063 vision of an integrated, prosperous, and healthy Africa. The Summit is a launchpad for this generational agenda, placing African agency at the center of global health and forging new solidarities with partners worldwide.",

The agreement is fully aligned with the Nigerian Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) and supports the Presidential Initiative on Unlocking the Healthcare Value Chain (PVAC) @PVAC_NG, a flagship under the NHSRII that aims to expand domestic production, crowd in private investment, and create high quality jobs across the health sector.\n\nThe Memorandum of Understanding establishes a structured framework for cooperation in critical areas, including vaccine access and production, starting with exploring possible government-to-government (G2G) procurement and progressing toward the local manufacturing of vaccines, essential medicines, and pharmaceutical raw materials in Nigeria over time. It further provides avenues for technical cooperation, knowledge exchange, and skills development, all of which are essential to building a resilient, inclusive, and future ready health system for our people both in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nThis partnership strengthens the bonds of South — South cooperation and affirms the shared commitment of Nigeria @NigeriaGov and Brazil @govbr to building sustainable, high performing health systems that deliver value, equity, and biosecurity for their people.\n\nUnder the leadership of President Tinubu, we are laying a generational foundation for a stronger, more inclusive, and investment ready people focused health system, anchored on equity, quality outcomes, resilience, and impact.",

As Board Chair of FIND @FINDdx, a WHO-designated partner for diagnostics, and Special Envoy to the Access to #COVID-19 Tools Accelerator under the leadership of Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus @DrTedros at the World Health Organization @WHO, she has consistently championed equitable access to the tools that save lives—especially for populations often left behind in global health responses.\n\nHer appointment comes at a critical time. Antimicrobial resistance is projected to cause over 10 million deaths annually by 2050, with Africa already facing a disproportionate burden. Limited access to timely diagnostics and medicines continues to drive resistance, compounding health inequities. As Ministerial Global Envoy, Dr. Alakija will support the work of the Ministerial Advisory Committee, strengthen domestic and global engagement, and ensure that One Health integration and diagnostic equity remain central to the AMR response.\n\nHer mandate includes high-level advocacy, technical engagement, and partner coordination—building on her previous leadership with the African Union’s Vaccine Delivery Alliance (AVDA), the #G7 Impact Investment Initiative on Global Health, and her extensive experience in pandemic preparedness and emergency response.\n\nThis appointment aligns fully with the objectives of the National Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) and the broader Renewed Hope Agenda of HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT, which prioritises integrated, multisectoral, and institutionally coordinated approaches to complex health challenges, including AMR.\n\nNigeria remains committed to delivering a technically sound, inclusive, and impactful AMR conference in 2026, building on the Jeddah Commitments and working closely with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman, and our partners across the Quadripartite—@WHO, @FAO, @WOAH, and @UNEP.\n\nWe thank Dr. Alakija for accepting this responsibility and look forward to her contributions in advancing Nigeria’s leadership and shaping outcomes that support global and regional progress on AMR.\n\n#AMR #Nigeria2026 #OneHealth #Diagnostics #NHSRII #RenewedHopeAgenda #GlobalHealth #FIND #WHO #HealthEquity",

My colleague, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, former Minister of Health and member of the Global Leaders Group on AMR, will also support the process.\n\nI thank all participating ministers, agencies, and partners, especially @NCDCgov, for their leadership. This effort is fully aligned with the National Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) and reflects the sector-wide approach we have adopted under the Renewed Hope Agenda: one that prioritises institutional coordination, sustainability, and national ownership.\n\nThe Advisory Committee will meet regularly to provide strategic guidance and coordination. NCDC will serve as the secretariat and lead the technical planning, supported by multisectoral working groups, in line with our sector-wide commitment. Coordination with @WHO, @FAO, @WOAH, and @UNEP will ensure alignment with global standards.\n\nOur objective is clear: to host a technically sound and impactful global conference that advances practical action on AMR—across access, stewardship, innovation, and financing—reflecting both Nigeria’s priorities and Africa’s broader context.\n\nFurther details on registration, agenda, and side events will be shared in due course.\n\n#OneHealth #AMR #Nigeria2026 #NHSRII #HealthSecurity #SectorWideApproach",

    "text": "Today in Abuja, I had the honour of addressing delegates from over 60 countries at the 5th Global Congress on Sickle Cell Disease @GlobalSCDN. This gathering could not have come at a more critical time. As Nigeria deepens implementation of the National Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) under the Renewed Hope Agenda #RenewedHope of His Excellency President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR @officialABAT, we are focused on repositioning healthcare from the ground up—beginning with the primary care level.\n\nSickle cell disease remains one of the most prevalent yet neglected genetic disorders across the African continent. In Nigeria, thousands of children are born each year with the disease, many of whom die prematurely from preventable complications such as severe anaemia and infection. This is not only a public health challenge—it is a social injustice.\n\nYet, we know that the path to transformation is clear. Interventions such as newborn screening, early diagnosis, routine vaccination, and access to disease-modifying therapies like hydroxyurea can reduce child mortality from sickle cell disease by more than 80 percent. The cost is low, the science is sound, and the tools are available. What we must now ensure is access and scale.\n\nIn line with our national commitment, Nigeria has begun to expand sickle cell screening and management services across six designated centres of care. A new national guideline for prevention and management has been adopted and updated. We are also partnering with local pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide affordable access to hydroxyurea. Most significantly, I am pleased to announce that the Center of Excellence for Sickle Cell Disease Research and Training in Abuja will now be upgraded to an International Centre of Excellence—serving not just Nigeria, but the West African sub-region and the global community.\n\nThis is only a beginning. As we strengthen our primary healthcare systems, we must also break the silence and stigma around sickle cell disease, invest in awareness, promote early detection, and bring services closer to the people. The burden of this disease is disproportionately borne by countries like ours, yet the global response remains limited. That must change.\n\nI call on subnational governments, African health ministries, research institutions, industry leaders, and development partners to join us—not just in words, but in action. Let us integrate sickle cell disease into national NCD strategies. Let us invest in local manufacturing of essential commodities. Let us back our commitments with resources.\n\nSickle cell disease has been neglected for far too long. In this season of renewed hope, we are choosing to act.",

It reflects the administration’s resolve to move beyond emergency stopgaps and institutionalize structural solutions that deliver real and lasting impact.\n\nThis bold policy innovation, designed as a public-private partnership, leverages the federal government’s purchasing power to secure better prices from domestic manufacturers and suppliers. MediPool’s wide-ranging mandate includes procurement planning, supply chain and logistics management, quality assurance, regulatory compliance, financial oversight, and structured support for local pharmaceutical production.\n\nI am pleased to share this overview of a transformative national initiative. With the approval of MediPool, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has once again demonstrated clear, courageous leadership in confronting the longstanding challenges of affordability and access—bringing hope to millions of Nigerians who have too often borne the dual burden of illness and the high cost of care.",

This milestone initiative will train up to 500 clinicians over the next three years and is projected to serve approximately 2,000 oncology patients and 350,000 diagnostic clients annually.\n\nIn the coming days, three newly built cancer centers — there would be a total of six — at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Katsina @Official_fthk; the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Nsukka @officialunth; and the University of Benin Teaching Hospital @ubthng will be formally commissioned by Mr. President and opened for public access—ushering in a new era of specialised care across the country.\n\nTo ensure seamless and sustained operations, key institutional personnel are currently undergoing advanced clinical and technical training in South Africa. Simultaneously, the National Health Insurance Authority @nhia_nigeria, has launched a targeted cost-sharing programme to expand access to cancer treatment. Under this initiative, eligible disadvantaged patients undergoing radiotherapy may receive subsidies of up to N400,000—significantly easing the financial burden on families and improving treatment adherence.\n\nGuided by the compassionate and reform-driven leadership of President Tinubu, and in full alignment with the Renewed Hope Agenda #RenewedHope, we are dismantling longstanding barriers—both on the supply and demand sides—to ensure that quality, affordable cancer care becomes a national standard, not an exception.\n\nI now invite you to explore these transformative facilities and engage with this special briefing on what they mean for the present and future of cancer care in Nigeria.",

As of April 30th, 2025, 73.61% of all planned modules have been completed, complemented by live sessions to reinforce learning and practical application within the local health governance ecosystem.\n\nTo ensure their learning is contextually grounded and not theoretical, each fellow has been paired with an experienced mentor drawn from a pool of 155 distinguished health sector leaders. By the end of April, over 2,145 structured engagements between fellows and mentors had taken place. Additionally, more than 6,000 follow-up calls have been made to monitor progress, resolve operational bottlenecks, and ensure that the initiative remains responsive to real-time needs.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to the State Commissioners for Health, the leadership of @AlgonNationalHQ @Algon_Nigeria, and Nigeria’s traditional institutions whose collaboration has enabled the seamless integration of the fellows into their host communities. Their presence is not just symbolic, it has been transformative.\n\nAs the fellowship advances, the focus is now shifting to capstone projects. Already, several fellows are demonstrating bold leadership by identifying context-specific challenges and co-creating solutions with stakeholders, signaling the emergence of a new cadre of health champions rooted in service and innovation.\n\nIn the months ahead, we in the health sector remain firmly committed to actualising the full vision of Mr. President’s investment in this initiative. We look forward, with resolve and conviction, to the contributions these fellows will make in shaping the future of Nigeria’s health system.",

    "text": "Under the innovative leadership of H.E. President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, @officialABAT, Nigeria has advanced 22 new large-scale health sector manufacturing projects funded by $5.5 billion in private sector capital, but as these new investments come into our country, our focus on cultivating a world-class pharmaceutical manufacturing workforce in-country has sharpened.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Nigeria recently securing €1 billion from the European Investment Bank (@EIB) and an additional $1 billion from AFREXIMBANK @afreximbank to incentivize health sector value chain localization, we have signed an agreement with the Empower School of Health @SchoolOf_health, Geneva, that will see to the establishment of Africa's foremost pharmaceutical manufacturing training institute, Empower Academy Nigeria.\n\nFunctioned to accommodate knowledge transfer in support of the local production of pharmaceutical excipients, active pharmaceutical ingredients (#APIs), and advanced dosage forms such as inhalers, extended-release medications, and dermatological patches, Empower Academy Nigeria will advance best practice in process engineering, regulatory compliance, quality control, environmental monitoring, and other important fields.\n\nWith a mandate and capacity to train and upskill up to 2,000 Nigerian professionals annually, supported by cutting-edge equipment and world-class facilities, Empower Academy Nigeria, @EmpowerGRP, will offer certification courses in partnership with Africa CDC @AfricaCDC, the World Health Organization (@WHO), UN Institute for Training and Research (@UNITAR), and the International Federation of Pharmacists, @FIP_org, amongst others.\n\nI am pleased to offer more detailed insight into the historic new development in this briefing from my desk.",

Our discussions focused on key shared priorities—sexual and reproductive health, non-communicable diseases, local manufacturing, and innovation—aligned with the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (NHSRII) under Mr. President’s @officialABAT Renewed Hope Agenda for improved health outcomes.\n\nAs we scale the Presidential Initiative on Unlocking the Healthcare Value Chain (@PVAC_NG), Bayer’s expressed interest in technology transfer, localized manufacturing, and potential engagement in the Anambra Pharma Park is timely and welcome. These areas of partnership are critical for expanding access, creating jobs, and driving the kind of health system resilience and industrial transformation we seek.\n\nI was also honoured by the thoughtful presentation of a personalized Bayer jersey bearing the number 10—a number traditionally reserved for the playmaker. In global football, the number 10 leads with vision, creates opportunities, and drives the game forward. In health, we are striving to do the same—acting strategically, leading from the front, and creating systems that work better for our people.\n\nMy thanks to the Bayer team, the PVAC secretariat, and our partners who continue to walk this path with us. The task ahead is significant, but so is our  collective resolve.",

    "text": "It was a profound honour to address the 7th Annual Capacity Building Workshop of the Association of Medical Councils of Africa (AMCOA), @22Amcoa today in Abuja, at a time when the migration of health professionals continues to test the resilience of health systems across our continent. For many countries, including Nigeria, this is not just about numbers—it’s about communities left underserved, professionals under pressure, and systems stretched thin. And while health worker mobility is not new, the scale and velocity today demand something more than concern—they demand deliberate, humane, and forward-thinking action.\n\nIt is in this context that Nigeria developed its National Policy on Health Workforce Migration—a bold yet measured response that recognises migration not as a crisis to lament, but as a structural challenge to govern with fairness and clarity. This is not a policy born of fear or restriction. It is grounded in empathy, realism, and a commitment to equity. It acknowledges that behind every departure is a professional with dreams, and behind every vacancy is a patient in need. In today’s interconnected world, mobility is inevitable—but what must be insisted upon is balance, reciprocity, and respect for the systems left behind.\n\nBy clearly defining the terms of engagement—rather than passively absorbing the consequences—we aim to protect the integrity of our health system while preserving the dignity of those who serve within it. The policy proposes practical measures: retaining and supporting our health workers, expanding training pipelines, strengthening ethical recruitment frameworks, and building structured, welcoming pathways for diaspora return and reintegration.\n\nThis direction is fully aligned with the bold reforms underway through the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII), under the visionary leadership of His Excellency President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR @officialABAT. As the African Union’s @_AfricanUnion Champion for Human Resources for Health and Community Health Delivery, the President’s commitment to human capital development continues to shape a more coordinated, values-driven approach to health workforce resilience across the continent.\n\nWe are beginning to see hopeful signs. Some young professionals are choosing to stay. Others are returning—not just with advanced skills, but with renewed belief in the possibilities at home. Our regulators, particularly the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) @MDCNOfficial, are stepping confidently into new roles—supporting reintegration, strengthening standards, and helping shape a fairer future for workforce governance.\n\nSincere appreciation goes to AMCOA, MDCN, the Nigerian Medical Association, Honourable Commissioners of Health, our diaspora partners, and international allies. Together, we are proving that mobility, when well governed, need not mean loss—but can become a pathway to shared progress, deeper equity, and a stronger, more resilient health system for all.",

    "text": "The 10th Ministerial Oversight Committee (MOC) Meeting of the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (#BHCPF) held this week in Abuja was to assess progress and address implementation bottlenecks. It also provided the opportunity for stakeholders to refine strategies to ensure that the Fund remains a transformative vehicle for achieving Universal Health Coverage (#UHC) and expanding access to quality healthcare, particularly for Nigeria’s most vulnerable populations.\n\nOver the past year, including today’s approval, 80 billion Naira has been disbursed to 8.000+ Primary Healthcare Centres (#PHCs) across all 36 states and the FCT, facilitating access to free maternal and child health services, essential medicines, and basic emergency care. The BHCPF has also enabled the enrollment of over a million poor and vulnerable Nigerians into the national health insurance scheme, ensuring protection from financial hardship due to medical expenses.\n\nDiscussions were anchored on governance, accountability, and performance-based financing, with a clear focus on ensuring that every Naira disbursed translates into measurable health impact. Data presented showed that some states have achieved up to 80% fund utilization, leading to improved service readiness, reduced stockouts of essential medicines, and enhanced healthcare access at the PHC level. However, we recognized the persistent challenges—including delays in fund deployment, reporting gaps, and the need for strengthened state-level capacity—that must be addressed to maximize the fund’s impact. A core resolution was the imperative for all states to fully optimize their allocated funds transparently and efficiently, ensuring direct benefits for communities.\n\nThe meeting also aligned the BHCPF with the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Initiative (#NHSRII) under the Sector-Wide Approach (#SWAp) to drive structural health financing reforms and enhance efficiency. There was a strong consensus on leveraging digital health innovations, biometric authentication systems, and enhanced real-time monitoring mechanisms to prevent leakages, improve accountability, and ensure equitable service delivery. Furthermore, community-based monitoring will be scaled up to institutionalize transparency and citizen engagement.\n\nThe BHCPF remains a key pillar of Mr. President’s #RenewedHope Agenda, reinforcing his commitment to an equitable, inclusive, and resilient health system. As the African Union (@_AfricanUnion) Champion on Human Resources for Health, His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, @officialABAT has placed strategic investment in human capital development at the core of his vision for health sector transformation in Nigeria and across the continent. This meeting reaffirmed our collective resolve to fast-track implementation, optimize resource allocation, and hold all stakeholders accountable for tangible results.\n\nI extend my appreciation to our state governments @NGFSecretariat, implementing agencies, development partners, and civil society stakeholders for their unwavering dedication to this national priority. With renewed urgency, we will continue to drive financial accountability, strengthen health governance, and ensure that millions more Nigerians receive the healthcare they deserve.",

    "text": "Today, on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare @Fmohnigeria, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (@icpcnigeria), represented by its Chairman, Dr. Musa Adamu Aliyu, SAN. This partnership is a critical step in strengthening governance, transparency, and accountability in the health sector, aligning with Mr. President’s @officialABAT #RenewedHope Agenda and the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Initiative (#NHSRII).\n\nHealth is fundamental to our national development, and ensuring that resources allocated to it are efficiently utilized is a top priority. Over the years, assessments have highlighted gaps in transparency and fiduciary integrity, particularly in areas such as procurement, contract execution, and resource allocation at the frontline of healthcare delivery. The commitment to addressing these challenges is embedded in the NHSRII, which recognizes that without strong governance mechanisms, even the most well-intentioned investments may not yield the desired impact. This collaboration with ICPC reinforces our commitment to preempting corruption, preventing financial leakages, and ensuring that funds meant for primary healthcare centers, medical supplies, and essential services reach the people who need them most.\n\nUnder this partnership, a framework for oversight and accountability will be established, leveraging both institutions’ mandates to monitor, assess, and intervene where necessary. This effort aligns with the broader governance reforms within the sector, which have already seen independent institutional reviews and strengthened audit mechanisms. By ensuring that resources are not only allocated but also effectively utilized, we aim to improve service delivery, optimize efficiency, and build public trust in the healthcare system.\n\nMr. President has made clear that transparency in healthcare financing and service provision is non-negotiable. The renewed focus on governance ensures that every Naira committed to health—whether for upgrading hospitals, supporting primary healthcare facilities, or delivering essential medicines—is used judiciously. The collaboration between the Ministry and ICPC is not just a policy statement; it is an actionable commitment to accountability and quality service delivery. Strengthening institutional capacity to detect and address financial mismanagement will ultimately translate into better health outcomes for Nigerians.\n\nAs we work toward a more resilient health system, partnerships like this will be instrumental in bridging gaps, mitigating risks, and fostering a culture of integrity. The health of Nigerians is too important to be compromised by inefficiencies, and with this renewed commitment to transparency, we are positioned to deliver on our mandate more effectively. We are not perfect as an institution, but the FMOHSW family is committed to continuing improvements.",

    "text": "This week marked an important step in our collective effort to strengthen primary healthcare in Nigeria as I addressed the National Stakeholder Engagement on Accelerating Improvement in Primary Health Care in Nigeria with Local Government Financial Autonomy. This engagement reinforced the critical role of local governments in delivering essential healthcare services to Nigerians, as outlined in the National Health Act 2014.\n\nFor decades, primary healthcare has been at the foundation of our public health system, shaped by deliberate policies and strategic interventions. The decision to strengthen local government financial autonomy presents an opportunity to improve service delivery at the grassroots level. But it also requires a shared commitment across all levels of government to ensure resources are efficiently deployed and aligned with national health priorities. The Act establishes a clear framework for collaboration, recognizing that primary healthcare is a collective responsibility.\n\nUnder the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR @officialABAT, a leader committed to strengthening federalism and deepening decentralization, we are advancing a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to health system transformation. Through the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Initiative (#NHSRII) and the Sector-Wide Approach (#SWAp), we are working to align efforts at the federal, state, and local levels to improve governance, service delivery, and financial sustainability in healthcare.\n\nCentral to this effort is the leadership of  @Muyi_Aina, ED, the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, who has continued to place the agency at the forefront of strengthening primary healthcare systems across the country. NPHCDA continues to provide the technical expertise and policy direction necessary for effective coordination of primary healthcare services, ensuring that local governments are equipped to deliver quality care. Development partners and civil society organizations have also played an instrumental role in advocating for stronger primary healthcare systems and supporting key interventions that improve health outcomes at the community level.\n\nHowever, financial autonomy alone will not solve our challenges. With health spending still below $14 per capita and local government contributions averaging just $3–$4 per capita, optimizing available resources is critical. States @NGFSecretariat must continue to play an active role in primary healthcare, ensuring alignment with national frameworks and providing oversight. The federal government @NigeriaGov remains committed to offering technical support and strengthening governance structures to ensure sustainable health financing and improved service delivery.\n\nTo truly build a system that works for Nigerians, we must remain focused on outcomes—strengthening immunization programs, expanding maternal and child health services, improving disease surveillance, and ensuring mental health care is prioritized. This requires active engagement from all stakeholders, particularly at the local government level, where services are delivered closest to the people.\n\nI call on all partners—state governments, local government leaders, ALGON @AlgonNationalHQ, @NphcdaNG, development partners, and civil society—to work together to ensure that financial autonomy translates into tangible improvements in primary healthcare. This is not just about policy; it is about the lives and well-being of Nigerians. \n\nTogether, we can build a stronger, more resilient health system that delivers quality care to every community.",

    "text": "Today, I shared insights on the remarkable progress Nigeria’s health sector is making at the Health Development Partners Retreat in Abuja. Guided by Mr. President’s @officialABAT #RenewedHope Agenda and anchored in the #NHSRII, we are improving how health services are delivered, financed, and sustained across the country. Yes, there are still many outstanding challenges— infrastructure, financing, affordability, and human resources issues— that are not yet completely resolved, but the direction is clear and the future is bright.\n\nOver the past 18 months, our commitment has been clear: to strengthen governance, expand access to quality healthcare, unlock the health sector’s value chain, and enhance health security. Working with our federal and state counterparts, development partners, and frontline health workers, we have laid a strong foundation for a sector-wide approach that fosters collaboration, efficiency, and accountability.\n\nThe Health Sector Compact, signed in December 2023 with the full endorsement of all 36 state governors and key development partners, remains a game-changer. It has provided a unified framework to channel investments— whether through on-granting to states, trust funds, or parallel but aligned financing mechanisms— ensuring more predictable, transparent, and impactful resource allocation.\n\nThrough this collaborative effort, we are witnessing real change. 60,000 health workers have been retrained to improve service delivery. Investments in PHC revitalization @NphcdaNG have increased, with direct funding to states through the #BHCPF and HOPE-PHC. Three new cancer centers are set to open in May, backed by a ₦100 billion investment in oncology infrastructure. The expansion of @nhia_nigeria coverage is ensuring that thousands of women receive free maternal and fistula treatment. Local pharmaceutical production is becoming a reality, reducing our dependence on imports and strengthening health security.\n\nThe past year has also tested our resilience. The HIV/AIDS funding crisis, which threatened the treatment of 1.5m Nigerians, was a stark reminder of the risks of overreliance on external funding. Instead of faltering, we mobilized emergency resources, strengthened our supply chain oversight, and accelerated local pharmaceutical manufacturing efforts. This crisis has catalyzed our push for greater self-sufficiency in essential medicine production— a vision that aligns with Nigeria’s ratification of the Africa Medicines Agency Treaty.\n\nOur digital transformation efforts are evolving. While initial progress focused on EMR, we now recognize the need for a broader digital health architecture that integrates patient registries, supply chain systems, and AI-driven analytics to improve service delivery. The upcoming 2025 Digital Health Blueprint will guide investments in telemedicine, real-time disease surveillance, and interoperability of health systems across states.\n\nNone of these strides would have been possible without the steadfast support of our partners. The  @USAGov, @PEPFAR, USAID, @WorldBank, @GlobalFund, @gavi @WHO, @UNICEF, @gatesfoundation, @CHAI_health, and several others have played pivotal roles in funding and technical support and implementation.\n\nLooking ahead, our focus must shift toward sustainable domestic financing. While donor support remains crucial, we are scaling up government allocations for health, exploring blended financing mechanisms, and strengthening private sector engagement to ensure long-term financial sustainability\n\nThis is not just about policy; it is about the lives we’re transforming and the future we are shaping. The ship we’re building is now sailing, and the plane we are assembling is in flight. Our destination is a stronger, more resilient health sector that every Nigerian can trust and take pride in. With the continued commitment of all stakeholders, we are poised to achieve a health system that ultimately delivers on the promise of equity, quality, and sustainability.",

    "text": "It was a profound moment today as His Excellency President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR @officialABAT, launched the National Health Fellows and unveiled the State of Health Report 2024—two landmark initiatives that reinforce this administration’s commitment to a stronger, more resilient health system under the #RenewedHope Agenda. The presence of young Nigerians—brimming with potential and standing as a testament to merit, accountability, and service—captured the significance of this moment. This is not just a program; it is the foundation of a deliberate and strategic movement to improve health outcomes, strengthen service delivery, and foster leadership across all levels of the sector.\n\nThe Fellows Program is a bold step toward investing in the next generation of health leaders, ensuring that talent is developed, nurtured, and deployed effectively. Out of over 360,000 applicants, 774 young men and women, representing every local government in Nigeria, were rigorously selected on merit. Their diverse expertise—spanning medicine, public health, technology, and policy—positions them as critical agents of change in the health sector. As President Tinubu aptly stated, the Fellows, “…are the future, the leaders of our health system, the torchbearers of a stronger and more resilient Nigeria.”\n\nBeyond this launch, the initiative signals a structural shift in how Nigeria cultivates and retains high-caliber talent within its health system. These fellows are not just recruits; they are workhorses of transformation, expected to strengthen accountability, improve service delivery, and enhance health system resilience at all levels. Recognizing the depth of their potential, I strongly advocated for their absorption into public service, reinforcing the need to retain skilled professionals within government institutions. President Tinubu affirmed this commitment, making it clear that these fellows are not just engaged—they are “hired.” This marks a decisive step in ensuring that investments in human capital translate into tangible improvements in health outcomes.\n\nThe unveiling of the State of Health Report 2024 further underscores this administration’s commitment to evidence-based policymaking. For the first time since the National Health Act 2014 mandated an annual health report, Nigeria now has a comprehensive, data-driven assessment of its health system. Developed through extensive collaboration with development partners, state governments, civil society, and technical experts, the report offers critical insights into sector performance and serves as a baseline for future interventions under the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Initiative (#NHSRII). The findings highlight early signs of measurable progress, demonstrating the impact of ongoing reforms while underscoring the need for sustained investments and accountability.\n\nI would like to recognize the technical expertise of Sector-Wide Approach (#SWAp) Office, led by its National Coordinator, Dr. Muntaqa Al-Sadiq @MuntaqaSadiq, for their pivotal work in translating policies into action, fostering accountability, and ensuring effective coordination across stakeholders. Their dedication remains a cornerstone of Nigeria’s health sector transformation.\n\nAs this movement gains momentum, the National Health Fellows now have both the platform and responsibility to translate this opportunity into sustained impact. Their work will strengthen frontline service delivery, drive innovation, and enhance accountability within the health sector. The task ahead is significant, but with the right support, policy continuity, and collective commitment, these fellows will drive the system-wide transformations needed to achieve equitable, quality healthcare for all Nigerians—fulfilling Mr. President’s vision of a healthier, more prosperous nation.",

President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, @officialABAT, we have worked assiduously alongside the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (#ALGON), State Health Commissioners' Forum, and the Nigeria Governors Forum (@NGFSecretariat) to retrain 60,000 frontline health workers, improve reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health, while scaling up financing for health infrastructure and leveraging innovation for further reform as we collectively achieve the objectives of H.E. President Bola Tinubu’s Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII).\n\nI have recently visited several State Governors across Northern Nigeria and we have welcomed dozens of our royal fathers in recent days to the Federal Capital Territory to assess progress on the ground. Without robust collaboration with our royal fathers and executive administrators, these objectives would be difficult to achieve and we realize that Nigeria’s health reforms have to be domesticated within our own cultural context, even as we advance progressive ideas for health sector now and in the future.\n\nI am delighted to share further insight into the criticality and substance of these collaborative efforts with you in this briefing from my desk.",

Under the leadership of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, @officialABAT, the government remains committed to strengthening primary health care as the foundation for equitable and sustainable health outcomes.\n\nFor 16 years, this committee has convened quarterly, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to grassroots engagement in immunization, maternal and child health, and broader primary health care reforms. This sustained effort reflects the whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach of the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal and Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) and the Sector-Wide Approach (#SWAp), ensuring governance effectiveness and improved health outcomes.\n\nDiscussions today focused on the fight against polio, particularly the continued circulation of Variant Poliovirus Type 2. Addressing this challenge requires stronger community engagement, enhanced accountability mechanisms, and improved frontline worker capacity to ensure effective immunization campaigns. The retraining of over 60,000 health workers underscores the government’s investment in human capital and expanding access to quality care. The revitalization of primary health care centers aligns with the President’s directive to ensure functional PHC facilities nationwide, while the Maternal and Newborn Mortality Reduction Initiative (#MAMII) @nhia_nigeria is eliminating financial barriers to emergency obstetric care.\n\nThe 𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡 𝐅𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦, with over 360,000 applicants, is another milestone in strengthening accountability and health leadership, selecting outstanding candidates purely on merit. Health system strengthening is further 𝐛𝐨𝐥𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐛𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭’𝐬 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐥 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐍𝟏 𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐨𝐧 ($𝟏.𝟐 𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐨𝐧) 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞-𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐆𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐞𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐏𝐇𝐂 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬, 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧. These interventions align with the NHSRII’s principles of strategic and results-driven investments in health.\n\nA critical part of today’s deliberations was the need to counter misinformation, particularly regarding immunization and public health interventions. Traditional leaders remain indispensable partners in fostering trust and ensuring that communities receive accurate health information. Their leadership, advocacy, and grassroots mobilization continue to be instrumental in strengthening public confidence in health programs.\n\nWe acknowledge and appreciate the leadership of 𝐇𝐢𝐬 𝐄𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞, 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐒𝐨𝐤𝐨𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐥, 𝐌𝐮𝐡𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐝 𝐒𝐚’𝐚𝐝 𝐀𝐛𝐮𝐛𝐚𝐤𝐚𝐫 𝐈𝐈𝐈, for his unwavering advocacy and commitment to improving health outcomes across Nigeria. We also commend the Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency @NphcdaNG, Dr. Muyi Aina @Muyi_Aina, for his dedication to advancing immunization and primary health care reforms.\n\nOur gratitude extends to development partners including @WHO, @UNICEF_Nigeria, @gavi @gatesfoundation, @Rotary, and all stakeholders whose collaboration ensures that these collective efforts translate into measurable improvements in health service delivery.\n\nAs we move forward, today’s discussions reaffirm that through sustained engagement, strong leadership, and collective resolve, we will continue to build a resilient health system that delivers quality care to every Nigerian.",

Through the MNH-MaMII Initiative, @nhia_nigeria, we aim to work with the state to ensure that every pregnant woman receives the care she needs.\n\nIn Sokoto State @SokotoGovtHouse, where maternal mortality stands at 977 per 100,000 live births, collaboration is key. With the Emergency Medical System #NEMSAS and ambulance scheme, expanded primary healthcare revitalization, and routine immunization efforts, we are ensuring that no woman or child is left behind.\n\nAcross these visits, we reaffirmed our whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach, working in alignment with H.E. President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s @officialABAT Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII). \n\nI’d like to thank my colleagues from @NphcdaNG led by its Executive Director, Dr. Muyi Aina, @Muyi_Aina, our partner, Chris Elias @ChrisJElias, President, Global Development, Gates Foundation, @gatesfoundation and other partner organizations for their support and collaboration.\n\nTogether with state governments, development partners, and frontline health workers, we will continue to drive sustainable reforms, ensuring affordable, quality healthcare for all Nigerians.\n\n#NigeriaHealthRenewal #ProjectHope #MaternalHealth #PrimaryHealthcare #HealthForAll",

These milestones reinforce our shared vision of a health sector that is resilient, responsive, and accessible to all Nigerians, built in a collaborative effort between the Federal Government and State Governments in line with the NHSRII / Sector Wide (#SWAp) policy of His Excellency President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR @officialABAT.\n\nAlongside His Excellency, the Executive Governor, we commissioned the 𝐁𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐥𝐬𝐚 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐇𝐚𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐞, a facility that will serve as a lifeline for individuals battling chronic kidney disease. By providing access to state-of-the-art dialysis services, this center will significantly reduce the physical and financial burden and the need for long-distance travel for care. The 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝟓𝟎𝟎-𝐁𝐞𝐝 𝐇𝐨𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐢𝐧 𝐁𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐥𝐬𝐚 𝐌𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 was also inaugurated, reinforcing the State’s commitment to primary healthcare revitalization, expanding patient access, and ensuring the next generation of medical professionals receives hands-on training in a well-equipped environment.\n\nEqually transformative was the launch of the 𝐙𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐃𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐅𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝟖𝟎𝟎𝐦 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐞 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐑𝐨𝐚𝐝, a pioneering investment in medical logistics and emergency response. With this facility, vaccines, blood products, and other critical medical supplies will be delivered swiftly to even the most remote communities, ensuring that no one is left behind due to geographic barriers. This innovation reflects our broader national strategy to strengthen health supply chain management, improve emergency preparedness, and deploy technology-driven solutions for healthcare delivery.\n\nThese projects align with Mr President’s #RenewedHope Agenda and the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (NHSRII). They are tangible demonstrations of health systems strengthening (#HSS), workforce development, and infrastructure expansion, key priorities in our journey toward Universal Health Coverage (#UHC). What we witnessed today in Bayelsa is proof that when leadership at all levels prioritizes health, when strategic investments are made, and when partnerships are strengthened, the impact is real and far-reaching.\n\nI extend my deepest appreciation to the Bayelsa State Government, the leadership of Bayelsa Medical University, frontline healthcare workers, and all stakeholders who made these projects a reality. Special recognition goes to Zipline @zipline and other development partners for their commitment to transforming healthcare access and logistics in Nigeria. It is through collaborations like these—between federal @NigeriaGov and state governments @NGFSecretariat, the private sector, civil society, and multilateral organizations—that we will truly build a stronger, more inclusive, and sustainable healthcare system for all Nigerians.\n\nOn a personal note, today held special significance as I was conferred with honorary citizenship of Bayelsa State by HE, Governor Douye Diri. As a Fulani man from Bauchi, now embraced by the people of Bayelsa, I am deeply honored by this gesture, which is a reflection of the unity and resilience that define us as a nation.\n\nToday’s event underscores what is possible when we focus on people-centered development, human capital investment, and innovative health system transformation. This is Renewed Hope in action and we sincerely thank HE President Tinubu for the opportunity to serve under his visionary leadership.",

    "text": "It was a pleasure to host partners and stakeholders in Abuja for a forward-looking discussion on nutrition, maternal and child health, and sustainable financing. This convening builds on the momentum of the Child Nutrition Fund (#CNF) in advancing evidence-based nutrition solutions that will improve the health and well-being of millions of Nigerian women and children.\n\nUnder the Renewed Hope Agenda of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, @officialABAT, the Federal Government has committed ₦1.2 billion in domestic resources to this initiative, with 11 to 15 states also stepping forward—demonstrating a whole-of-government approach to addressing malnutrition. These efforts are further strengthened by the Nutrition Department of the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, @Fmohnigeria which continues to play a crucial role in coordinating partnerships, policy alignment, and implementation.\n\nA key focus of our discussions was the transition from donor-supported programs to self-sustaining, locally driven solutions. It is encouraging that Nigerian manufacturers are increasingly investing in the production of Multiple Micronutrient Supplements (#MMS) and other pharmaceutical products, ensuring domestic availability while contributing to regional supply chains. This aligns with the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII), which prioritizes sustainable health financing, private sector participation, and strengthened healthcare delivery.\n\nThe CNF has been instrumental in scaling up nutrition interventions, with the support of @UNICEF, the UK Government @GOVUK, the Gates Foundation @gatesfoundation @FCDOGovUK, private sector actors, and global philanthropists. I particularly appreciate Spencer F. Kirk, Managing Director of Kirk Humanitarian @K_Humanitarian, whose donation of 6 million bottles of MMS has significantly strengthened efforts to improve maternal nutrition and child survival. The mass distribution of MMS in Nigeria represents a milestone achievement, already reducing maternal and neonatal mortality at scale.\n\nNigeria is making decisive investments in health and nutrition to drive long-term improvements in human capital development. The inclusion of MMS in the Essential Medicines List, expansion of maternal and child health interventions, and increasing role of domestic financing signal meaningful progress. These initiatives, guided by the visionary leadership of Mr. President, reinforce our commitment to ensuring the health and well-being of all Nigerians.\n\nA healthier and well-nourished Nigeria is a shared goal, and through sustained collaboration, we are making tangible strides toward achieving it.",

This decision represents a significant milestone in advancing healthcare governance, expanding primary healthcare services, and addressing critical gaps in human capital development.\n\nThese funds will be deployed in partnership with all 36 States of the Federation and the FCT, in line with the sector-wide policy and the Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative. The funds will support the recruitment, training, and retention of healthcare workers at the subnational level, ensuring that healthcare services are more accessible, responsive, and sustainable.\n\nAdditionally, the approval of N4.8 billion for the procurement of 150,000 HIV treatment packs over the next four months underscores the administration’s commitment to sustaining life-saving treatment and ensuring continued access to care for vulnerable populations.\n\nMuch appreciation to the Government @WhiteHouse and people of the United States @USAGov, as well as several other development partners, for 20 years of assistance to Nigeria’s fight against HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, saving lives and livelihoods. Nigeria is committed to owning and advancing its national health development priorities, improving domestic resource mobilization, strengthening health and biosecurity, unlocking private sector potential in the healthcare value chain, and fostering impactful partnerships with all countries.\n\nA cabinet committee comprising the ministries of health, finance, budget, defense, and environment will steer the development of a multi-level, multi-disease transition and sustainability plan towards Nigeria’s eventual exit from health aid dependency in the years ahead.",

It reinforces Africa’s high-level political will to end childhood HIV and protect maternal health by leveraging the advocacy and leadership of First Ladies to drive action, mobilize resources, and sustain momentum.\n\nNigeria has made significant progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS, advancing from a time when treatment was inaccessible to today, where over 1.5 million Nigerians are on life-saving therapy. These gains reflect strong strategic partnerships, and sustained investments in the health system. We appreciate the contributions of all our partners in this success, especially the US Government, Global Fund, and others. However, challenges persist in holding the gains, reducing new infections, preventing vertical transmission, and ensuring timely treatment for children and adolescents living with HIV. The Free to Shine Campaign aligns with our national efforts to close these gaps and ensure every Nigerian child is born HIV-free with access to essential care. \n\nAs global health priorities shift and international funding structures evolve, Nigeria will remain proactive in strengthening its domestic resource mobilization, unlocking private sector investments, and leveraging innovation for health system resilience. We see the imminent reset in global health approaches and financing as an opportunity to build healthier, more secure and equitable world respecting national leadership and sovereignty. We will continue to focus is on sustainability, fostering national ownership, and reducing dependence on external financing over time, ensuring ultimately a responsive and future-proof health sector, with strong biosecurity.\n\nUnder HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s @officialABAT leadership, we are steadily advancing this vision through the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (NHSRII), leveraging the Compact and Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp), to strengthen our governance, expand domestic financing, promote local manufacturing, private sector investments, and foster sustainable partnerships.\n\nI commend Her Excellency the First Lady, and the Renewed Hope Initiative  for their unwavering commitment to health equity and the next generation. Through sustained effective policy implementation, targeted investments, and innovative partnerships, we will build, over time, a stronger, more resilient health system—one where no child is born with a preventable disease, and every Nigerian has access to the care they need to thrive.",

    "text": "It was an insightful session today at the World Economic Forum @wef as I joined other global leaders, including Anita Zaidi @AnitaZaidi of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Catherine Russell @unicefchief of @UNICEF, and Bernd Montag @bernd_montag of Siemens Healthineers @SiemensHealth, to discuss the critical importance of investing in women’s health. It also provided an opportunity to share Nigeria’s bold reforms and achievements of HE President Bola Ahmed, GCFR, @officialABAT under the Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII). \n\nI highlighted the longstanding neglect of women’s health in global health policies, from reproductive and maternal health to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Through NHSRII, we are implementing targeted reforms to address these gaps. This includes revitalizing thousands of primary healthcare centers @NphcdaNG, training over 53,000 frontline health workers, and introducing financial protection mechanisms to ensure women can access essential services, including antenatal and emergency obstetric care, without financial hardship.\n\nOur approach integrates innovation and insights from women themselves. For example, focus groups in northeastern Nigeria revealed cultural misconceptions that limit the use of maternal health services, underscoring the need for policies grounded in the lived realities of women. Additionally, we are leveraging Nigeria’s mixed health system by working with the private sector to localize the production of reproductive health commodities and expand economic opportunities for women through job creation in healthcare.\n\nWe are also prioritizing women’s leadership in healthcare governance through initiatives like the National Health Fellows Program, ensuring women are at the forefront of shaping inclusive policies. These efforts are driven by our commitment to equity and reflect the broader Renewed Hope Agenda’s whole-of-society / whole -of-government approach to achieving better health outcomes for all Nigerians.\n\nI would like to acknowledge our moderator, Ms Fifi Peters @FifiPeters of CNBC Africa @cnbcafrica, for facilitating such a vibrant and insightful session that allowed us to explore these critical issues with depth and purpose.\n\nInvesting in women’s health is not just a health priority; it is essential for economic and social transformation. Through collaboration, shared accountability, and innovation, we can close the gaps and accelerate progress toward universal health coverage, leaving no woman behind.",

    "text": "It was a deeply touching moment this evening as Dr. Kelechi Ohiri @k_ohiri, Director General of the National Health Insurance Authority (@NHIAnigeria), presented the remarkable progress of the Fistula-Free Programme (#FFP). Since its launch in June 2024, this initiative has already treated 1,629 women suffering from obstetric fistula, out of 1,898 applications, while enrolling 922 beneficiaries into health insurance. These achievements exemplify the compassionate leadership of HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, @officialABAT in saving lives and bridging healthcare inequities.\n\nThe programme goes beyond medical treatment, offering holistic care that includes feeding, transportation, and post-care follow-ups, ensuring women are reintegrated into society with dignity and hope. Active across 42 facilities nationwide, including in conflict-affected regions like the Northeast, the FFP demonstrates how health equity can reach even the most marginalized. A testimony shared this evening underscored this impact—a woman, once rejected, isolated and contemplating suicide due to stigma, now stands restored, a powerful symbol of resilience and the programme’s transformative reach.\n\nThis effort is supported by partnerships with development partners such as @USAID and @UNFPA, and national stakeholders like State Health Insurance Agencies and National Identity Management Commission @nimc_ng. These collaborations have driven innovation and inclusion, overcoming challenges such as the lack of identification through NIMC registration and ensuring follow-up care with low-cost mobile phones. Streamlined claims processes further highlight the programme’s emphasis on accountability and access.\n\nThe tireless efforts of Dr. Ohiri and his team, alongside Chief Medical Directors, civil society organizations, and traditional and religious leaders, reflect the extraordinary outcomes that unity of purpose can achieve. Their unwavering dedication is restoring dignity to thousands of women and transforming communities in profound ways.\n\nAs the programme prepares to scale up to all tertiary and secondary health facilities by 2025, it reaffirms the exceptional value of health spending under the Renewed Hope Agenda. The Fistula-Free Programme is more than a health intervention—it is a beacon of equity, compassion, and resilience, proving that strategic investments in health can transform lives, inspire hope, and strengthen the fabric of our nation.",

This coalition, co-established with CEPI and the West African Health Organization @OoasWaho, symbolizes our region’s leadership in addressing one of its most pressing health challenges while contributing to global health security.\n\nThe LFGE is a bold step toward ensuring accessible, safe, and effective vaccines, over time, through a coordinated, regionally owned approach. \n\nBy fostering collaboration across governments through the instrumentality of WAHO, with technical support from global partners like Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations @CEPIvaccines and World Health Organization @WHO, this Coalition reflects a commitment to addressing Lassa fever with rigorous ethical standards while strengthening the resilience of our health systems to respond to emerging threats. Lassa Vaccine development has already reached significant milestones, with Phase 2 clinical trials underway in Nigeria, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, signaling hope for an effective vaccine to combat this longstanding health challenge by the end of the decade.\n\nWe reaffirmed the region’s singular commitment to tackling Lassa fever and identified actionable strategies to address both immediate and long-term challenges. These include enhancing public awareness to reduce rodent-human transmission, equipping health workers with training and protective tools to mitigate their exposure risks, and ensuring equitable access to vaccines and treatment for vulnerable populations, particularly women and children. By adopting a regional commons approach, the coalition is not only addressing Lassa fever but also building a foundation for responding to other infectious disease threats while advancing regional and global health security.\n\nI extend my appreciation to the DG, WAHO, Dr. Melchior Athanase J.C. AÏSSI, CEO CEPI, Dr. Richard Hatchett (@DrRHatchett), DG @NCDCgov, Dr Jide Idris and colleague Ministers of Health from Benin, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as well as senior representatives from CEPI, WAHO, and the World Health Organization (WHO), including its African Regional Office @WHOAFRO. Together, we are building a future where health threats like Lassa fever are met with proactive, unified, and sustainable responses, anchored in equity, inclusivity, and scientific rigour.",

Approved under HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s @officialABAT Renewed Hope Agenda, PVAC is driving economic growth and health security through healthcare transformation.\n\nIn one year, PVAC has achieved a $5 billion project pipeline, $2 billion in foreign investments, and 74 transformative projects. Partnerships with global leaders like @SiemensHealth, @BHR_BIOSYNEX, @vestergaard, @GSK, @AbbottNews, @BASF, and @moderna_tx, as well as the integration of clinical trials, position Nigeria as a leader in Africa’s healthcare and R&D ecosystem. The Executive Order signed by Mr. President has provided tax and duty exemptions, catalyzing local manufacturing.\n\nThese milestones have been supported by @FinMinNigeria under Chief Wale Edun, @fmitiofficial, @NafdacAgency, @NIPRD2, @nsia_nigeria, and @NgCustoms, who have ensured quality standards, streamlined processes, and infrastructure investments.\n\nAs we approach 2025, the “Year of Execution,” PVAC will focus on scaling local manufacturing, deepening partnerships, and reducing costs while improving access. The aim is to create 500,000 jobs and generate billions in revenue by 2028, making healthcare a cornerstone of Nigeria’s economic transformation.",

With a total allocation of ₦279.2 billion and over ₦143 billion disbursed to states and the FCT, since its inception, the BHCPF is now one of the cornerstones of Mr. President’s @officialABAT Renewed Hope Agenda to transform the health sector.\n\nThe Fund’s impact has been remarkable: more than 10 million Nigerians have accessed critical services in BHCPF-supported facilities, with over 2.6 million beneficiaries added in the last year alone. Financial protection for vulnerable populations is improving, as evidenced by the growing utilization of primary healthcare services across the country. Additionally, 8,354 primary healthcare centers (#PHCs) @NphcdaNG have received direct facility funding quarterly in the last 12 months. \n\nWhile challenges remain—ranging from infrastructural gaps to procedural delays—the resilience and collaboration of all stakeholders are enabling steady progress. The unwavering commitment of Mr. President and State Governors @NGFSecretariat, complemented by strategic partnerships with development partners, civil society, and state commissioners of health, continues to drive these reforms forward.\n\nAs we continue to consolidate these early achievements, we are convinced that the health sector is progressing steadily toward a better future. Our commitment to the reforms remains unwavering as we build resiliency, strengthen public trust, and deliver equitable and quality healthcare for all Nigerians.",

When the SERVICOM Office @ServicomOffice in the Presidency @NGRPresident announced today that the Ministry had emerged as the recipient of four distinguished awards—𝑺𝒑𝒆𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍 𝑹𝒆𝒄𝒐𝒈𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑨𝒘𝒂𝒓𝒅, 𝑴𝒐𝒔𝒕 𝑰𝒏𝒏𝒐𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝒊𝒏 𝑻𝒆𝒂𝒎 𝑨, 𝑩𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒊𝒏 𝑻𝒆𝒂𝒎 𝑨, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝑶𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝑩𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑴𝑫𝑨—it was more than an acknowledgment of effort. It was a declaration that our collective work, our systems, and early results are making a real difference. These awards are a symbol of unwavering commitment to excellence in service delivery and to the promise we strive to fulfill every single day.\n\nThe Special Recognition Award holds particular significance as it acknowledges the Ministry’s sustained drive to connect government to citizens and to touch lives through quality service delivery in Nigeria. It is a validation of the processes we have strengthened, particularly through the Sector-Wide Approach (#SWAp)—the enabling catalyst that has aligned efforts across government, development partners, and other stakeholders to drive meaningful change.\n\nWhen the President, His Excellency Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, @officialABAT, declared on December 12, 2023, that “health is back on the front burner of Nigeria’s policy agenda,” it was a charge to act, and we did. Under the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII), we have advanced reforms that are beginning to restore confidence in our systems—revitalizing primary healthcare, improving health security, and ensuring access to care for all Nigerians.\n\nThese awards are a testament to the dedication of all my colleagues—former Minister of State, Dr. Tunji Alausa @DrTunjiAlausa (now HME @NigEducation), my colleague, Hon Iziaq Adekunle Salako, @SalakoIziaq, the Permanent Secretary, Directors, SERVICOM Teams, Heads of Agencies and Hospitals, Regulatory Bodies, and all the great staff within the FMOHSW ambit.\n\nFor me, as Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, and for the entire Ministry, this moment is humbling. It reinforces the fact that the reward for a job well done is more work. These recognitions challenge us to do even more—to innovate further, to perform better, and to deepen our collaboration with all stakeholders to ensure that no Nigerian is left behind in our quest to deliver improved quality healthcare.\n\nWe dedicate these awards to the people of Nigeria whom we serve and to the Commander-in-Chief, who has provided the enablement to serve.",

This achievement is not just a milestone for the pharmaceutical sector but a decisive step in our collective efforts to unlock Nigeria’s health sector value chain. The country’s path to medical industrialization is being paved one step at a time. The commissioning today, once again, proves that progress is not just possible—it is inevitable.\n\nHis Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR @officialABAT, is resolute in transforming the health sector from a consumption-driven model to one that creates jobs, protects economic value, and strengthens domestic manufacturing capacity. The Beta Lactam facility stands as a testament to what can be achieved when government policies align with private sector vision and perseverance.\n\nThe importance of this development cannot be overstated. For too long, Nigeria has relied heavily on imports for even the most basic healthcare commodities. This facility brings us closer to breaking that dependence. By producing essential antibiotics like Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid locally, we not only ensure supply chain security but also reduce costs for consumers, particularly the most vulnerable populations.\n\nThis milestone is aligned with the Executive Order signed by Mr. President in June, aimed at stimulating domestic manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, test kits, medical textiles, and consumables. The Order also incorporates market-shaping interventions to enable government procurement to prioritize local manufacturers. While implementation challenges have been addressed collaboratively with key stakeholders, I am pleased to note that this policy is now positioned to deliver on its intended objectives.\n\nI must also commend the indefatigable work of Dr. Abdu Mukhtar @Dr_AbduMukhtar, the @PVAC_NG Coordinator, and his dedicated team. Their relentless efforts have been instrumental in advancing key initiatives to unlock the healthcare value chain, ensuring that industrialization in health moves from policy to action.\n\nAs we advance, the government’s commitment remains clear: we will continue to support the pharmaceutical industry through policies that promote industrialization, job creation, and economic growth. Regulators such as @NafdacAgency and the Pharmacy Council of Nigeria @PCN_Registry have been tasked with enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in their operations. Our goal is to ensure a regulatory environment that is robust and facilitative—one that encourages the industry to thrive without undue constraints.\n\nToday, we are witnessing tangible outcomes. Over 700 young Nigerians have already secured quality employment through this facility, directly contributing to household incomes and lifting communities. This is the economic and social impact of industrialization in action—job creation, retained earnings, and increased production capacity that can serve Nigeria and the African continent.\n\nTo our partners in the Federation of Nigerian Pharmaceutical Industry, I extend my sincere congratulations. Your hard work to establish new plants, expand existing ones, and innovate within a challenging landscape reflects a shared resolve to secure Nigeria’s health and economic future.\n\nTo Jawa International, I congratulate your staff and management, particularly the Managing Director, Chief Varkey Verghese, MFR, my brother, Barrister Boss Mustapha, and other Board members on this significant achievement.\n\nTogether, we are building a health sector that serves the dual purpose of improving health outcomes for our citizens and driving economic value for our nation.",

We had a productive exchange on key health sector priorities, particularly in the context of the National Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII).\n\nOur discussions centered on our shared experiences leading decentralized federal health systems and the critical role of collaboration between federal, state, and local governments in ensuring equitable health access across regions. Indonesia’s @IndonesiaGov success in leveraging public funds and partnerships to drive healthcare reform resonated strongly, particularly as Nigeria continues revitalizing primary healthcare centers @NphcdaNG through the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (#BHCPF). We also discussed Indonesia’s innovative use of third-party logistics and technology solutions to manage a complex vaccine and PHC supply chain across thousands of islands.\n\nOpportunities for closer collaboration on vaccine manufacturing were another key focus, especially given that BVNL, a joint venture co-owned by the Nigerian government @NigeriaGov, already partners with Indonesia’s BioFarma @biofarmaID. Indonesia’s achievements in local vaccine production offer valuable insights as Nigeria works toward sustainable models for its vaccines program @PVAC_NG. This aligns with the NHSRII’s commitment to increasing resilience and sustainability through local production of medical supplies.\n\nHealth security, a key pillar of our agenda, was also emphasized. Indonesia’s advancements in genomic surveillance and emergency health systems provided a strong foundation for discussions on enhancing Nigeria’s capacity to detect and respond to health threats. Nigeria remains committed to improving surveillance capabilities, supported by partnerships with organizations like the Africa CDC (@AfricaCDC) and the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (@NCDCgov), and to advancing global collaboration against emerging health crises. We agreed on the need for collective action among Global South nations @GlobalSouthF to strengthen the Global Commons @globalcommonshq in preparation for future pandemic threats.\n\nAs we continue advancing the NHSRII under the visionary leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu (@officialABAT), we look forward to leveraging lessons from Indonesia’s healthcare innovations to build a more resilient and sustainable health system for Nigeria. We are excited about our team’s planned knowledge exchange visit to Indonesia in the New Year, further cementing this important collaboration.",

This gathering was both a reflection on our collective achievements and a reaffirmation of our shared commitment to transforming healthcare delivery across the nation.\n\nOver the past year, we have witnessed what strong leadership and collaboration can achieve. By Q3 2024, 31 out of 41 KPIs under the Presidential Commitments had been met, with reforms under the Basic Health Care Provision Fund ensuring that over 8,000 health facilities were supported and ₦46 billion disbursed. Infrastructure upgrades under the Sector-Wide Approach and Project HOPE @projecthopeorg have revitalized 238 health facilities to Level 2 functionality, with 320 more in progress and plans to scale up to 4,000. Additionally, 53,000 frontline health workers were retrained this year, significantly enhancing service delivery at the grassroots level.\n\nThese efforts are translating into measurable results. Under-five mortality has declined by 16.7 percent between 2018 and 2023, contraceptive use has increased in 17 states, and health security indices have risen from 39 to 54 percent. Public confidence in healthcare continues to grow, with 54 percent of Nigerians affirming the government’s capacity to manage health emergencies, up from 37 percent in 2023. These outcomes demonstrate what we can achieve when we work together.\n\nHowever, challenges persist. Many households still face catastrophic health expenditures, and gaps in immunization and nutrition remain critical concerns. Emerging threats such as tuberculosis require sustained focus, as do efforts to close disparities in healthcare access. These challenges remind us of the need for continued vigilance and investment to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nThe evening underscored the importance of visionary leadership. Achieving these outcomes requires commitment from governors, commissioners, and traditional leaders, whose roles are indispensable. I particularly commend the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee for their significant contributions to polio eradication and routine immunization. Their efforts exemplify the principle that solutions must be locally driven to succeed.\n\nI extend my gratitude to the Nigeria Governors’ Forum @NGFSecretariat, the FCT Minister @OfficialFCT, and state commissioners for their dedication. I also thank our development partners, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation @gatesfoundation, @UNICEF, @WHO, and civil society organizations, for their support in mobilizing resources and advancing our health agenda.\n\nLooking ahead, with Mr. President’s @officialABAT recent approval of a major health relief initiative for 2025, we are well-positioned to address immediate challenges while building a resilient and inclusive health system. Health is not only a fundamental right but also the foundation of national prosperity. A healthy population drives education, productivity, and stability. When children thrive, our nation thrives.\n\nI congratulate Anambra State @anambrastate_ and Governor Charles Soludo @CCSoludo for emerging the winner of this year’s grand prize as well as other States that did well for their people. Ultimately, I believe, by the mercies of God, we shall all win in our quest for an equitable, healthy and prosperous Nigeria. \n\nLet us remain resolute in our mission to improve health outcomes for all Nigerians. Together, we can inspire hope, unify communities, and deliver quality healthcare for all. My deepest gratitude goes to everyone making this progress possible.",

    "text": "Today marked a significant milestone for Nigeria’s health transformation as Her Excellency, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, CON (@SenRemiTinubu), the First Lady of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Grand Commander of the Fight Against TB, hosted the High-Level Event: Political Leadership to End TB during the 38th Board Meeting of the Stop TB Partnership Global. With the theme “Public-Private Partnership and Integrated Service Delivery: Panacea to End TB in Nigeria” and the rallying call to “Be Part of the Solution to End TB in Nigeria,” the event emphasized the importance of collective action and collaboration in tackling TB. As both the Global and National Stop TB Champion, Her Excellency’s leadership continues to drive Nigeria’s efforts to combat tuberculosis, a disease that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations. Her personal commitment, underscored by a generous N1 billion donation to support TB initiatives and her advocacy for local manufacturing of TB vaccines, has positioned Nigeria as a key player in addressing global health challenges.\n\nThis event also coincided with Universal Health Coverage (#UHC) Day, marking the first anniversary of the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Initiative (#NHSRII), anchored in the Sector-Wide Approach (#SWAp), launched by His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR (@officialABAT), on December 12, 2023. The NHSRII has made significant strides over the past year. The National Health Insurance Authority (@NHIAnigeria) expanded coverage by 2 million Nigerians, bringing the total to 19.4 million insured individuals, reducing financial barriers to healthcare access and ensuring that more Nigerians are covered.\n\nAdditionally, 238 primary healthcare centers (PHCs) (@NphcdaNG) have been revitalized, with 300 more underway, and efforts are in progress to restore 4,000 PHCs with the support of development partners. Significant progress has also been made in maternal health, with 1,000 fistula repairs completed and free emergency obstetric services steadily being introduced.\n\nOver the past year, more than 53,000 healthcare workers have been retrained as part of our broader plan to retrain 120,000 workers, ensuring improved quality of care and addressing gaps in service delivery. The expansion of specialized healthcare services includes the upcoming opening of the first two hugely revamped cancer treatment centers by May 2025, with four more to follow, along with ongoing upgrades to tertiary healthcare facilities. Through partnerships with the private sector, critical opportunities within the healthcare value chain have been unlocked, creating jobs and enhancing service delivery across the nation.\n\nThe integration of TB care into Nigeria’s primary healthcare system remains vital to achieving UHC. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in healthcare financing. With only $15 per capita currently invested in health, and high out-of-pocket expenses challenging many households, Nigeria still faces substantial gaps in access and affordability. To address these, President Tinubu has approved the Medical Relief Program, set to begin in an expanded fashion in the next budget cycle, which will reduce healthcare costs for the most vulnerable populations.\n\nThe achievements of the past year under the NHSRII and the SWAp demonstrate that, with collective action, Nigeria can build a more resilient, effective, efficient, quality, and equitable health system on its path towards UHC.",

    "text": "A very reflective exchange this evening with Secretary Teodoro Javier Herbosa (@Teddybird), MD, Secretary of Health, Republic of the Philippines (@govph), and H.E. Mersole J. Melchor, Ambassador of the Philippines (@PHInNigeria) to Nigeria, on our shared imperative to address complex health system challenges with practical, sustainable solutions.\n\nWe shared insights on the importance of strengthening health workforce capacity as a critical pillar of resilient health systems. The Philippines’ strategies, such as return service agreements and targeted training expansions, offer valuable lessons as we implement reforms under the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal and Investment Initiative (#NHSRII). These approaches resonate with our commitment to balancing domestic workforce needs with the realities of increasing global demand, while maintaining the highest standards of care for our people—particularly as exemplified by the visionary Health Workforce Migration Policy, signed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR (@officialABAT), in his wisdom as @_AfricanUnion Champion for Human Resources for Health and Community Health Delivery Partnership.\n\nReforms of this nature must ultimately be measured by their impact on the lives of individuals: a mother accessing quality reproductive health services, a child receiving life-saving vaccinations, or a nurse empowered with advanced skills to serve their community—all represent the human outcomes that guide and define our policy decisions.\n\nOur discussion also highlighted the transformative potential of primary healthcare innovations and the opportunities for generating domestic financing for healthcare investments. Secretary Herbosa’s insights on ambulatory and urgent care centers provided a compelling example of how decentralized care models can bring services closer to underserved communities while relieving pressure on tertiary institutions. This aligns closely with our vision for revitalizing primary healthcare in Nigeria to ensure it is accessible, adaptive, and people-centered.\n\nThe exchanges reaffirm the value of collaboration between nations with similar aspirations and shared challenges. The partnership between Nigeria and the Philippines represents a unique opportunity to learn from each other’s experiences and jointly advance practical solutions to strengthen health systems.\n\nI remain deeply committed to translating these shared insights into actionable reforms that deliver tangible results. Health system transformation is not just a technical ambition for us—it is a moral imperative to invest in the health and wellbeing of our people and to secure a healthier future for generations to come.\n\nThank you, Secretary Herbosa and Ambassador Melchor, for an engaging and inspiring conversation. Partnerships like this are a testament to the power of shared commitment in building health systems that are resilient, equitable, and responsive to the needs of all.",

    "text": "In line with our regular parleys with key stakeholders, we @Fmohnigeria convened this week with the U.S. Government @USinNigeria @USAGov delegation led by Ambassador Richard Mills Jr. and Dr. John Nkengasong @JNkengasong, the Global AIDS Coordinator @PEPFAR and their team, to strengthen our collective efforts in tackling #HIV/AIDS and advancing Nigeria’s health priorities. This engagement reaffirmed the enduring partnership between Nigeria and the United States, a collaboration rooted in shared values and a mutual commitment to improving lives and fostering sustainable health systems.\n\nThe discussions were purposeful and solution-oriented, reflecting on Nigeria’s progress in expanding HIV treatment, a milestone achieved with the steadfast support of #PEPFAR, @USAID, and @CDCgov. This partnership has been instrumental in aligning global expertise and resources with Nigeria’s health sector transformation agenda, ensuring tangible impact and sustainability.\n\nA key focus of the meeting was addressing critical gaps in preventing mother-to-child transmission (#PMTCT) and pediatric HIV treatment. Both sides explored opportunities for enhanced collaboration through frameworks emphasizing accountability, measurable outcomes, and shared milestones. These efforts will be integrated into the ongoing expansion of Nigeria’s primary healthcare system, spearheaded by @NphcdaNG, which remains central to delivering equitable and sustainable health services.\n\nLocal manufacturing was a key highlight of our discussions, underscoring its importance for health security and economic empowerment. Nigeria, with its significant population and strategic position, is committed to fostering domestic production of essential commodities such as test kits and medications. By creating an enabling environment—through reduced tariffs on raw materials, off-take agreements, and other incentives—the government aims to attract private sector investments, including from U.S. companies. This approach not only strengthens supply chain security but also creates jobs and positions Nigeria as a manufacturing hub for the continent.\n\nCapacity building remains at the heart of our health reforms. Over the past year, 53,000 frontline health workers have been retrained to deliver integrated, high-quality services, ensuring programmatic sustainability and resilience. These efforts, combined with the $750 million mobilized through Project Hope @projecthopeorg for primary healthcare expansion and immunization, reflect Nigeria’s commitment to addressing immediate needs while laying the foundation for long-term systemic improvements.\n\nThe engagement also reinforced the Federal Government’s @NigeriaGov unwavering financial commitment to health. As fiscal space improves, investments in HIV treatment, test kits, and health infrastructure will continue to scale, safeguarding the gains achieved over the last two decades and ensuring progress in combating emerging challenges.\n\nThis week’s deliberations with the U.S. delegation underscore the extraordinary partnership between our two nations—a partnership built on trust, mutual respect, and a shared vision for a healthier future. The continued support of the U.S. Government, championed by leaders like Dr. Nkengasong, has been instrumental in driving results, fostering resilience, and inspiring confidence in the future of Nigeria’s health sector.\n\nTogether, we are not just addressing today’s challenges; we are laying the foundation for a transformative and sustainable health system that meets the needs of all Nigerians and sets an example for the continent and beyond.",

    "text": "This week, I addressed the National TB Conference 2024, themed “Public-Private Partnership and Integrated Service Delivery: Panacea to End TB in Nigeria.” This landmark conference underscores Nigeria’s commitment, under the leadership of @NigeriaGov, to eliminating tuberculosis—a disease that continues to impact millions of lives.\n\nUnder the inspiring leadership of HE, Sen. Oluremi Tinubu, CON (@SenRemiTinubu), the First Lady of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Global and National Stop TB Champion, Nigeria has galvanized stakeholders across sectors to act decisively in the fight against TB. Her dedication serves as a beacon of hope, uniting diverse partners and demonstrating the transformative power of leadership and collaboration.\n\nGuided by the pragmatic vision of HE, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR (@officialABAT), under the Renewed Hope Agenda, our efforts prioritize health as a unifying force for prosperity and recovery. A significant milestone is the private-sector TB initiative launched in July 2024, aimed at mobilizing pledges of up to $25 million from key industries, including banking, manufacturing, and oil and gas. These partnerships are pivotal for expanding prevention, diagnosis, and treatment services—particularly for vulnerable populations—and for embedding TB interventions into workplaces and communities.\n\nNigeria continues to face a significant TB burden, ranking as the country with the highest number of TB cases in Africa and the sixth globally. In 2023 alone, an estimated 371,000 cases were notified—our highest ever recorded—marking substantial progress in detection while highlighting the scale of the challenge. Through frameworks such as the Sector-Wide Approach (#SWAp) and the National Compact, we are fostering accountability, mobilizing domestic resources, and aligning with global best practices. These include shorter drug regimens for drug-resistant TB. Specific innovations, such as the expansion of GeneXpert machines from 1,032 in 2012 to 5,113 in 2023, the use of mobile X-rays for active case finding, and the integration of TB and HIV services, have been instrumental in improving outcomes. In 2023, 98% of TB patients were tested for HIV, reflecting a comprehensive approach to care.\n\nThe gains we have made would not have been possible without the steadfast support of key stakeholders driving the global and national fight against TB. Special recognition goes to Dr. Lucica Ditiu (@LucicaDitiu), ED, Stop TB Partnership (@StopTB), whose visionary leadership has advanced global TB interventions and inspired transformative action. I also acknowledge Dr. Jean Kaseya (@JeanKaseya2), DG, Africa CDC (@AfricaCDC), whose call for Africa to lead in manufacturing its own TB vaccines and other medical consumables aligns deeply with our shared vision for sustainable health solutions. Innovative financing mechanisms—including debt-for-health swaps, private sector investments, and expanding health insurance coverage—are central to sustaining and scaling these interventions. For every $1 invested in TB programs, $43 in societal benefits is generated through reduced healthcare costs, improved productivity, and strengthened social cohesion.\n\nThe conference also highlighted the critical role of community mobilization and the active engagement of Nigerian youth and researchers in advancing TB detection and treatment. Their contributions, alongside strengthened public-private collaborations, are driving the momentum needed to achieve our goals. The fight against TB is not just a health priority—it is a developmental and moral imperative. Eliminating TB is a fight for justice, equity, and human dignity, and it demands decisive action from all of us.\n\nTogether, we are building the structures, partnerships, and momentum needed to end TB in Nigeria and lead Africa’s charge in the global fight against this disease. A TB-free Nigeria is not just a goal; it is an achievable reality, and we must act decisively to make it happen.",

    "text": "Over the past weekend, I had the honour of presenting Nigeria’s health sector agenda at the Doha Forum 2024 @DohaForum under the theme, “From Challenges to Change: Enhancing Global South Health through Collaboration.” Engaging with global leaders, we explored shared challenges and opportunities for advancing health equity. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that trillions of dollars in global resources can be mobilized at scale during crises, underscoring the urgent need to shift focus toward preventative and sustainable investments in global health security.\n\nI shared the remarkable progress Nigeria is making under the visionary leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT, the African Union’s @_AfricanUnion Champion for Health, who has spearheaded comprehensive reforms to harmonize federal and subnational policies, ensuring no Nigerian is left behind. Over the past year, we have retrained 53,000 frontline health workers, deploying them to underserved areas, and redirected domestic financing to prioritize primary health care. This includes a focus on prevention and early intervention to address diseases before complications arise. These reforms also encompass expanding the functionality of primary health care systems and operationalizing the Vulnerable Groups Fund to protect pregnant women by ensuring affordable access to lifesaving services, such as cesarean sections, in line with our commitment to reducing maternal mortality.\n\nI also highlighted that while global resources are available, the challenge lies in mobilizing political will and fostering collective action to invest in health.\n\nI am deeply grateful for the meaningful discussions I had with key global leaders, including Dr. Chris Elias @ChrisJElias of the Gates Foundation @gatesfoundation ; Mr. Mawaf Al-Hammadi and Mr. Yousef bin Ahmed Al-Kuwari of Qatar Charity @Qatarcharityc; H.E. Mansoor Al-Mahmoud, Qatar’s Minister of Public Health; and H.E. Fahad Hamad Al-Sulaiti of the Qatar Fund for Development @QatarFund. These engagements focused on critical areas such as strengthening Nigeria’s primary health care systems, expanding medical outreaches, supporting immunization programs, unlocking Nigeria’s healthcare value chain, and exploring innovations from Qatar, particularly in emergency medical systems, blood transfusion services, and rehabilitation care.\n\nI am particularly excited to announce that selected Nigerian health professionals will be visiting Qatar on an exchange program in early 2025, in line with predetermined criteria. This exchange will provide an opportunity to engage with the Qatar Rehabilitation Institute and other health facilities, learning from their world-class systems and applying these insights to enhance Nigeria’s healthcare delivery. These engagements reaffirm the power of collaboration to drive meaningful progress, not only for Nigeria but for the broader Global South.",

While the Act had remained largely under-implemented for some time until 2023, we reignited its ideals, prioritizing swift execution and an adaptive approach. By shifting from the traditional 90% focus on planning to one centered 90% on action and real-time feedback, we have made tangible progress in a relatively short period.\n\nWhile gaps remain, the tangible gains achieved underscore our dedication to saving lives, reducing physical and financial pain, and advancing Universal Health Coverage #UHC. These strides reflect a balanced approach toward delivering immediate impact while laying the foundation for the long-term transformation of the sector.\n\nAs we look ahead, we are resolute in addressing remaining gaps, scaling innovative solutions, and building on these achievements. With the support of our partners and the trust of Nigerians, we remain steadfast in our mission to deliver a health system that serves every citizen and fulfills the transformative vision of Mr. President’s Renewed Hope Agenda.",

    "text": "It was an honor to represent the Vice President of Nigeria, HE Senator Kashim Shettima @KashimSM, GCON, at the 3rd National Health Summit on “𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝐍𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚: 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭” in Abuja today. Organized by the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) @nationalnma under the leadership of 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐟. 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚 𝐌𝐨𝐡𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐮𝐝𝐮, Vice Chancellor of the Federal University of Health Sciences Azare @fuhsaofficial, the summit provided a vital platform to reflect on the progress we have made, the challenges ahead, and the partnerships driving our shared vision of a stronger, more equitable healthcare system for all Nigerians.\n\nWhile our healthcare system has demonstrated strengths, critical gaps remain. Maternal mortality and outbreaks like diphtheria highlight inequities in care and vaccination coverage, while affordability continues to be a major barrier for many Nigerians. Public perception surveys show growing confidence in the sector, a testament to ongoing reforms, yet hurdles such as fragmented governance, uneven healthcare worker distribution, and financing constraints still hinder the system’s full potential.\n\nUnder the visionary leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT, the bold reforms we have initiated are actively addressing these issues. Through the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII), over 1,000 primary healthcare centers now receive direct funding through the revitalized Basic Health Care Provision Fund #BHCPF2.0, ensuring resources reach facilities and communities most in need. Emergency obstetric care has been expanded, with 30 hospitals offering prequalified emergency obstetrics services, including free cesarean sections and fistula repair surgeries, breaking down financial barriers that too often lead to preventable tragedies.\n\nWe are advancing infrastructure development at an unprecedented pace. Six cancer centers and eight diagnostic facilities are under construction, with three set to open by May 2025. Solarization of critical hospital units and the installation of oxygen plants in 44 tertiary hospitals are further strengthening care delivery. To address human resource shortages, training quotas for medical professionals have doubled, and 43,000 frontline health workers have already been retrained, advancing toward the target of 120,000 by 2027. The Health Workforce Migration Policy is improving working conditions to ensure the retention and better distribution of healthcare professionals.\n\nOur governance reforms are fostering greater alignment and accountability, while the historic Compact signed with all 36 governors @NGFSecretariat, the FCT Minister @OfficialFCTA, and development partners exemplifies a unified commitment to shared priorities. This collaboration has enabled the mobilization of over $1 billion through the Presidential Initiative to Unlock the Healthcare Value Chain @PVAC_NG, boosting local production of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, reducing reliance on imports, and creating jobs.\n\nThe partnership with NMA leadership and our development partners has been pivotal to these successes. Their dedication and collaborative spirit reflect the unity of purpose necessary to achieve sustainable progress in healthcare delivery.\n\nThese achievements, driven by President Tinubu’s leadership, underscore our collective resolve to save lives, reduce suffering, and ensure equitable access to quality care for all Nigerians. While challenges remain, the progress made within just one year is a powerful demonstration of what is possible when well-crafted policies are paired with decisive action. Together, we are building a resilient healthcare system that will stand as a cornerstone of national development for generations to come.",

    "text": "On November 7, 2024, the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital (@ATBUTHINFO) launched a free cesarean section outreach under the Maternal Mortality Reduction Innovation Initiative (#MAMII @SWApGov), marking a significant step in the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare’s (@Fmohnigeria) efforts to save lives. Two weeks after the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Health Insurance Authority (@NHIAnigeria), this outreach has already started to deliver free, lifesaving care to women, removing the financial barriers that too often cost lives. We are at the early stages but optimistic that we can expand this carefully and rapidly in the period ahead.\n\nMAMII is central to our fight against maternal mortality, particularly intensely targeting 172 high-burden local government areas that account for over half of all maternal deaths. By providing free cesarean sections for poor and vulnerable women who meet eligibility criteria, and ensuring these services are accessible in both public and private facilities empaneled by NHIA, this initiative demonstrates how health equity can become a reality.\n\nAs part of the broader strategy, the revitalized National Emergency Medical Service and Ambulance System (@Nemsas_fmoh) ensures timely transport to care, while health workers and community efforts continue to generate awareness and strengthen access to emergency obstetric services. This outreach at ATBUTH exemplifies MAMII in action, reinforcing the Tinubu @officialABAT Administration’s Renewed Hope Agenda and commitment to reducing maternal and newborn deaths across Nigeria.\n\nThe FMOHSW commends the health workers and partners for making this possible and reaffirms its commitment to ultimately delivering care that reaches every mother and child in need.",

Over the years, this partnership with RTSL has delivered real results—from integrating NCD management into primary healthcare, recently empowering millions through the “Know Your Numbers” campaign, led by State governments, and strengthening our core public health capacities. \n\nResolve to Save Lives has been a key ally in reinforcing Nigeria’s health security framework. Initiatives like the 7-1-7 target for rapid outbreak detection and response, along with new collaborative surveillance systems, are essential steps toward a robust, future-ready infrastructure capable of managing health threats swiftly. Their support extends to policy reforms that promote local production of essential medicines, reducing our reliance on imports and ensuring Nigerians have access to affordable, quality medications.\n\nStrengthening this collaboration is crucial as we pursue the ambitious target we have set under the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Initiative (NHSRII) in line with Mr President’s @officialABAT Agenda to improve quality health outcomes for all Nigerians. Together, we are creating a health system that not only meets today’s needs but is resilient enough to face tomorrow’s challenges. Our shared commitment is clear: to close the gap in access to quality care, safeguard public health, and ensure every Nigerian has the healthcare they deserve, securing a brighter, healthier future for all.",

By combining cutting-edge technology with skilled personnel, this partnership embodies Mr. President’s vision under the NHSRII for a healthcare system that meets the highest standards of excellence and addresses the real needs of the Nigerian people.\n\nWe commend the leadership of 𝐌𝐫.

This historic gathering provided a platform to evaluate our progress, synchronize our strategies, and outline a shared path toward realizing the transformative goals of the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative #NHSRII. The JAR has enabled us to assess our achievements, address challenges, and set clear priorities, establishing a critical foundation of transparency, accountability, and evidence-based planning in Nigeria’s health sector.\n\nThe past three days were informative and productive, enabling us to launch key life-saving initiatives and strengthen essential partnerships. In addition to the transformative 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐧 𝐌𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 (𝐌𝐀𝐌𝐈𝐈), which offers 𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆 𝒄𝒆𝒔𝒂𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒏 𝒔𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔 𝒕𝒐 𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒊𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝑵𝒊𝒈𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒂𝒏 𝒘𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒏 𝒎𝒆𝒆𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒄𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒂, we also unveiled the N𝐢g𝐞r𝐢a C𝐥i𝐦a𝐭e C𝐡a𝐧g𝐞 𝐚n𝐝 𝐇e𝐚l𝐭h V𝐮l𝐧e𝐫a𝐛i𝐥i𝐭y a𝐧d A𝐝a𝐩t𝐚t𝐢o𝐧 (V&A) 𝐀s𝐬e𝐬s𝐦e𝐧t R𝐞p𝐨r𝐭.\n\nThe V&A Report provides essential insights into the impacts of climate change on health across Nigeria. By identifying climate-related health risks, the Report supports the creation of a resilient health system capable of addressing the challenges posed by a changing environment, underscoring our commitment to sustainable health security and the well-being of Nigerians.\n\nAnother key outcome was the establishment of a dedicated 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐭 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐩 (𝐄𝐖𝐆) focused on strengthening our national health data systems. The EWG will implement regular health mini-surveys, bridging the current five-year gap in data collection from the National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). Through timely and reliable data, the group will empower us to track progress, address emerging health threats, and make informed, data-driven decisions essential to the sector’s success.\n\nThe importance of the Joint Annual Review cannot be overstated. More than a review process, the JAR is a testament to our commitment to building a health system that is transparent, accountable, responsive, and resilient. By setting this review in motion, we have laid a foundation for continuous improvement and adaptation.\n\nWe extend our deepest gratitude to everyone who contributed to the success of this JAR. Special thanks go to our technical teams, led by the Permanent Secretary and staff of the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare @Fmohnigeria, the SWAp Coordination Office team led by Dr. Muntaqa @MuntaqaSadiq. We are equally grateful for the support of heads of federal agencies @NphcdaNG, @NHIAnigeria, @NCDCgov, @NACANigeria, @NafdacAgency, the Nigerian Institute Of Medical Research\n @nimrnigeria, @PVAC_NG, all 36+1 State Commissioners of Health and their Permanent Secretaries, Heads of Agencies, Foreign Missions, Association of Local Governments of Nigeria @ALGON, @FCDOGovUK, the @WHO, @UNICEF, @gavi Alliance, The Global Fund @GlobalFund, @USAIDGH, @WorldBank, @gatesfoundation, Nigerian academia, private sector, civil society, media, and all our various partners across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones. This broad collaboration embodies the NHSRII’s whole-of-society and whole-of-government approach, reflecting our shared commitment to health resilience.\n\nTogether, by the grace of God, we will achieve our shared goal of establishing a strong foundation for a healthier, safer, and more prosperous Nigeria. Thank you all for your dedication, commitment, and partnership on this transformative journey.",

    "text": "The aim of the Joint Annual Health Review (#JAR) is to conduct a thorough assessment of Nigeria’s healthcare system, identifying challenges and implementing impactful solutions to ease both the physical and financial burdens on our people.\n\nIn line with HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s @officialABAT Renewed Hope Agenda and the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII), we are pleased to announce on Day 2 of the JAR the launch of the transformative “𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐌𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 (𝐌𝐀𝐌𝐈𝐈)”—an ambitious commitment to reducing maternal and newborn mortality across Nigeria.\n\nA pivotal feature of this initiative is the provision of free cesarean sections for poor and vulnerable women who meet eligibility criteria, covering services provided through both public and private facilities empaneled by the National Health Insurance Authority (@NHIAnigeria). By removing financial barriers to this life-saving procedure, we ensure that no woman in need is denied critical care due to cost. Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high, with 172 local governments contributing to over 50% of maternal deaths. By focusing resources on these high-burden areas, MAMII will address the greatest areas of need. The NHIA, in collaboration with the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (@NphcdaNG) and State Health Insurance Agencies (SHIAs), will manage the reimbursement process, ensuring that providers across both sectors can deliver these essential services sustainably.\n\nCommunity health workers play a crucial role in this mission, in line with Mr. President’s initiative to onboard 120,000 additional health workers to support primary care across Nigeria. These workers are essential in generating demand for maternal care services within communities, educating families on the importance of antenatal care, and ensuring that mothers are informed about available services. In rural and underserved areas, where accessing healthcare facilities remains a challenge, community health workers act as vital links between families and the healthcare system, bringing lifesaving information and support to their doorsteps.\n\nIn these same areas, the National Emergency Medical Service and Ambulance System (#NEMSAS) @Fmohnigeria, has been revitalized to provide timely transport for emergencies, bridging a key gap in both maternal and newborn care by bringing emergency services closer to those who need them most.\n\nOur achievements and today’s announcement would not have been possible without the vital support of our development partners, whose resources, expertise, and alignment with Nigeria’s health priorities have been instrumental. Their commitment exemplifies a shared dedication to health equity and the well-being of every Nigerian. We also call on all stakeholders—state governors, healthcare leaders, community members, and health workers—to actively support and drive the success of this initiative.\n\nThe Maternal Mortality Reduction Innovation Initiative represents an immediate, determined response to Nigeria’s maternal and newborn health challenges. Through demand generation, expanded primary and emergency care, and the removal of financial barriers, we are advancing a healthcare system that is truly accessible, affordable, and effective for all Nigerians.\n\nTogether, we are building a future where no mother or child is left behind in accessing the quality, affordable care they deserve.",

This review reflects our commitment to improved population health, strengthened infrastructure, and expanded affordable healthcare access for all Nigerians.\n\nWe express our profound gratitude to His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR @officialABAT, whose visionary leadership prioritizes health as a cornerstone of his #RenewedHope Agenda. Recognizing human capital as the bedrock of a healthy, productive Nigeria, Mr. President’s commitment to increasing federal health funding for 2024 is pivotal in advancing this vision for our young and dynamic population.\n\nAligned with this agenda, the past year has seen substantial achievements: a 16.7% reduction in under-five mortality, a 40% decrease in diarrheal diseases, and marked reductions in tuberculosis and HIV prevalence. These improvements demonstrate our resolve to make healthcare affordable and accessible for all, particularly the most vulnerable.\n\nOur PHC 2.0 reform has enabled equitable resource distribution, with over 45 billion Naira allocated to support more than 8,000 primary healthcare centers. This funding, bolstered by over 3 billion dollars in partner contributions, is building a robust foundation for community-based and affordable healthcare that reduces financial burdens on Nigerians. However, significant challenges remain in maternal mortality, malnutrition, and stunting, which we are addressing through the 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐧 𝐌𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞. By targeting 174 high-burden LGAs, we aim to significantly reduce maternal deaths through accessible, life-saving care.\n\nToday’a JAR also launched the inaugural State of Health Report and the Health Vulnerability and Adaptation Report, highlighting the links between climate change and health. Working closely with the Ministry of Environment @FMEnvng, we are committed to protecting Nigeria’s most vulnerable communities from climate-related health risks. In addition, the new State Health Scorecard, based on DHS data, provides an objective view of each state’s performance, enabling informed, constructive dialogue and continuous improvement toward health equity nationwide.\n\nOur achievements reflect the dedication of key leaders and partners. Special thanks to Governor Hope Uzodinma @Govhopeuzodinma of Imo State, our guest of honor and the Governors Forum @NGFSecretariat; Senator Dr. Ipalibo Harry Banigo @HarryBanigo, Chair of the Senate @NGRSenate Health Committee and her distinguished colleagues; Dr. Tunji Alausa @DrTunjiAlausa, my colleague and now Minister of Education @NigEducation; @Fmohnigeria colleagues and Dr. Banji Filani @okeanaye, Chair of the Commissioners of Health Forum, alongside all 36 State Commissioners. Their partnership has been critical in advancing localized healthcare solutions. Under Dr. Muntaqa’s @MuntaqaSadiq leadership, the SWAp Coordinating Office has aligned stakeholders across all government levels. We extend our deep gratitude to our development partners and to Nigeria’s health workers, whose commitment ensures these policies reach every community, keeping healthcare available, accessible, and affordable.\n\nAs we move forward, we are committed to strengthening these partnerships and accelerating progress toward a resilient, and equitable healthcare system. Today’s JAR reinforces our shared vision for a healthier Nigeria, where quality healthcare is accessible to every Nigerian, irrespective of social class, without undue financial burden.\n\nTo all our partners, leaders, and health workers—thank you. Together, we are building a future where, by the grace of God, every Nigerian has the opportunity to lead a healthy, fulfilling life.",

This landmark agreement strengthens our resolve to address child mortality with Africa-led, evidence-based solutions, promising renewed hope for millions of families in vulnerable communities.\n\nWith active programs in Burkina Faso @gouvernementBF, Côte d’Ivoire @Gouvci, Mali @GouvernementM, Niger @PresidenceNiger, Nigeria @NigeriaGov, and Sierra Leone @Presidency_SL, REACH deploys biannual azithromycin treatments to prevent life-threatening infections in children under five.

We also owe immense gratitude to Professor Samba Sow @ProfessorSow for his visionary leadership and to Mr. Bill Gates @BillGates and the Gates Foundation @gatesfoundation for their unwavering support in making this initiative a reality.\n\nLooking ahead, the success of REACH could transform not only child health but the broader health landscape across Africa. Imagine a future where children grow up healthier, communities grow stronger, and our healthcare systems are resilient and self-sustaining—allowing every African child the chance to thrive and fulfill their potential.

    "text": "Central to the implementation of the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) through a #SWAp is an unwavering commitment to transparency, accountability, and the active involvement of Nigerian citizens in shaping our health systems. Today’s pre-Joint Annual Review (#JAR) media parley underscores our dedication to keeping Nigerians informed on our processes and activities—a commitment that began well before the NHSRII was formalized. For instance, through the Citizens’ Voice Survey conducted last year, we gathered invaluable insights from nearly 2,500 Nigerians to better understand their perceptions of healthcare, which in turn shaped our priorities in formulating our strategy.\n\nAt next week’s JAR, we will take a groundbreaking step as stakeholders from all sectors—state commissioners of health, development partners, and local governments—come together to collectively review our progress. This marks the first time such an inclusive review is conducted at a national scale, not just to assess results but to actively co-create solutions for a transformed health sector. We’re now equipped with data from the 2023 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and baseline indicators from across states, enabling us to track progress and make evidence-based decisions in key areas over the coming years.\n\nIn the last year, we’ve made concerted efforts to address critical health areas, including #RMNCA health. By using a data-driven approach, we’ve identified that maternal mortality is highly concentrated in 172 local governments, which account for over half of all maternal deaths. These findings allow us to focus interventions where they are most needed, with targeted support to reduce maternal mortality and improve health outcomes for mothers and children.\n\nThe ongoing perception survey across all 36 states, covering over 2,600 Nigerians this year, provides further insights into public sentiment on healthcare services. Results show a positive trend in the public’s perception of primary and tertiary healthcare services, although challenges remain in secondary healthcare, highlighting areas for improvement. The feedback indicates that while the private sector is generally seen as having quality services, public healthcare is also recognized for quality, particularly at the primary care level. Such nuanced insights allow us to continuously refine our strategies to meet public expectations effectively.\n\nAddressing access disparities, particularly in underserved and remote areas, remains a key priority. Through partnerships with the @NphcdaNG and other stakeholders, outreach programs have been expanded to bring healthcare closer to hard-to-reach communities. Additionally, the deployment of ambulances, emergency response resources, and planned riverine area-specific initiatives underscore our commitment to inclusive healthcare.\n\nNext week’s JAR is designed as an interactive platform, not merely a review. This session, enriched by citizens’ feedback, will enable honest, constructive discussions on the state of Nigeria’s health sector. Our objective is not only to showcase achievements but to collectively address challenges and set actionable priorities. The insights gathered will culminate in the first-ever State of Health Report, which will be shared with Mr. President @officialABAT, the @nassnigeria, and the Nigerian public. This report will establish a benchmark for health sector performance and hold us accountable in an ongoing dialogue with the citizens we serve.\n\nAs we look toward the upcoming JAR, we thank the media for their continued partnership, which plays a crucial role in keeping Nigerians informed. Through collaborative efforts, we strive to ensure a health system that is transparent, accountable, and increasingly responsive to the needs and felt concerns of our citizens. This process reinforces that every step under the NHSRII is a stride toward a healthier, more resilient Nigeria for all.",

    "text": "Forward-looking conversation with GSK @GSK today focused on the local production of essential pharmaceutical consumables, reinforcing Nigeria’s commitment to self-reliance in healthcare. This aligns closely with Mr. President’s @officialABAT Presidential Initiative for Unlocking the Healthcare Value Chain (@PVAC_NG), a core component of Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII), aimed at transforming Nigeria into a global hub for health product manufacturing and innovation.\n\nThe PVAC framework supports local manufacturing to reduce import dependency, boost economic resilience, and meet the healthcare needs of our growing population. GSK’s commitment to investing in Nigeria’s health sector through localized production marks a significant step toward achieving these objectives. This partnership not only advances Nigeria’s health security but also strengthens our capacity to lead in the African healthcare market. By fostering such collaborations, we are working to make high-quality healthcare accessible to all Nigerians, in alignment with the bold vision set forth by Mr. President under PVAC.\n\nWe express our appreciation to GSK’s leadership, including Kunle Oyelana (Vice President, Head of General Medicines, Europe), James Bingham (General Manager, Head of Partner Markets Region), and their team for their keenness to align with this shared vision. Their commitment strengthens our collective pursuit of a resilient, accessible, and affordable healthcare system. I’d like to specially recognize Dr. Abdu Mukhtar @Dr_AbduMukhtar, the PVAC Coordinator, whose relentless efforts in executing Mr. President’s mandate inspire confidence that our joint sacrifices will soon yield a stronger, healthier and more prosperous Nigeria.",

    "text": "At the kickoff of the 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟒 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 𝐖𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝐢𝐧 𝐀𝐛𝐮𝐣𝐚 today, I was honored to join distinguished members of the National Assembly, including the Rt Honorable Speaker, Dr. Tajuddeen Abbas @speaker_abbas, represented by the Chief Whip, my brother Hon. Bello Kumo @KumoUsmanBello; Chairman, House Committee on Budget and Appropriations, Hon. Abubakar Bichi; Chair, House Committee on Health Institutions, Hon. Amos Gwamna; Hon. Austin Achado; Prof. Usman Malami Aliyu, DG, National Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment @NicratGov; members of the Federal Ministry of Health @Fmohnigeria; development partners CSOs; private sector leaders; health workers; cancer survivors; and all those united in our mission to tackle cancer in Nigeria.\n\nThis year’s theme, “𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐍𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚’𝐬 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐨 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥: 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩,” reflects our shared commitment to confront the rapid growth of cancer and to adopt a forward-thinking, collaborative approach.\n\nI extend my profound gratitude to the LOC for orchestrating this commemorative event. It symbolizes our collective determination to drive change, acknowledging both the survivors whose resilience inspires us and the healthcare workers dedicated to improving cancer care in our nation. From oncologists and nurses to pharmacists and radiotherapists, each of you plays a vital role in not only treating but also providing hope to those affected by this disease.\n\nUnder HE President Tinubu’s @officialABAT visionary leadership, our administration has placed population health at the heart of the #RenewedHope Agenda. As NCDs, such as cancer, continue to escalate, we recognize the urgency to act now. The burden is growing swiftly, and with limited resources, infrastructure, and personnel, we must prioritize both prevention and early intervention.\n\nToday’s observance of the first National Health Promotion Day aligns seamlessly with our ongoing efforts under the #NHSRII to improve population health and establish a cohesive national response. These frameworks emphasize collaboration with States, Development partners, and other stakeholders to address critical health challenges, including cancer, and to build a robust health system.\n\nOur approach spans preventive measures, such as the Hepatitis B birth dose for liver cancer and HPV vaccines for cervical cancer—a campaign that has led to one of the world’s highest coverage rates among girls in Nigeria. Alongside this, we’re expanding access to screenings—mammography, colonoscopy, PSA for prostate cancer—to ensure that detection occurs early, when chances of survival are highest. Importantly, President Tinubu has approved the commissioning of six major cancer infrastructure projects, with the first two expected to be operational by May 2025, as well as expanding diagnostic centers and training the oncology workforce.\n\nThanks to these efforts, cancer is no longer a death sentence for everyone. Advances in genomics, precision medicine, and innovative treatments bring us closer to transforming cancer care. Our goal is to build an environment where all Nigerians are empowered to take proactive steps: get screened, seek treatment, and find support.\n\nTo further this vision, I call on the National Assembly @nassnigeria to continue its invaluable investment in cancer infrastructure, equipment, and human resources. Additionally, establishing a #CatastrophicHealthFund to support cancer care is essential to prevent families from slipping into poverty due to costly treatments. This Fund would provide critical financial protection for Nigerians, particularly as cancer treatments are among the most financially devastating.\n\nTogether, with determination, compassion, and a commitment to innovation, we will address the cancer challenge and build a healthier future for all Nigerians. Thank you.\n#CancerHealthWeek",

    "text": "Today, on World Polio Day, we reflect on the global effort to eradicate polio—a disease that once paralyzed over 350,000 children every year. Thanks to relentless commitment and collaboration, wild poliovirus has been eliminated across Africa, including Nigeria. However, the work is not yet complete.\n\nWe must push forward in every ward, local government, and state to ensure that no child is missed. The children we reach with polio vaccines can also benefit from other essential services like nutrition and healthcare, helping to secure a brighter future for all.\n\nAs we continue this fight, we are guided by the vision of HE President Bola Tinubu’s @officialABAT #RenewedHope Agenda, which places the well-being of the Nigerian people at its core. By ensuring that every child is reached with life-saving vaccines and essential healthcare services, we are not only protecting the future of our children but also building a healthier and more prosperous Nigeria.\n\nI would like to extend a special thanks to the Sir Emeka Ofor Foundation for embodying the true spirit of collaboration by bringing together the 3 Ts—time, treasure, and talent. The time invested by individuals like Sir Emeka Ofor @SirEOffor and countless volunteers, the treasure in resources generously contributed by Rotary International and others, and the talent within our communities are all being harnessed to tackle this shared challenge.\n\nAs we celebrate today, we must also recognize that our mission is not yet complete. I call on all states, local governments, traditional and religious leaders, and civil society to ensure every child is fully vaccinated. Whenever you see a child, make sure they receive their vaccinations. This is how we will safeguard our country and rid ourselves of this preventable disease once and for all. We have done it before with smallpox, and I am confident we can do it again with polio.\n\nTogether, let us end polio now and deliver on the Renewed Hope for a healthier future for all Nigerians.\n\n#WorldPolioDay2024 #EndPolioNow",

    "text": "It was an honor to deliver the keynote address at the Future of Health Conference #FHC 2024, marking its 10th anniversary. This platform has been pivotal in addressing critical issues, and this year’s theme—𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐄𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡 𝐍𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐬—could not be more timely. The climate and health crisis is not a future threat; it is already affecting Nigeria and the world today, with consequences that will shape our future. The effects of climate change—through flooding, droughts, and the rise of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever—are becoming more apparent. Cholera outbreaks, driven by climate-related water contamination, further highlight the urgency of this crisis.\n\nClimate change is affecting health in multiple ways. Beyond infectious diseases, worsening air quality is driving an increase in non-communicable diseases (#NCDs), which are now among Nigeria’s fastest-growing health burdens. Disruptions to food systems are compounding malnutrition and food insecurity. The implications are not just environmental but extend to our economy and security, particularly in regions facing desertification, where migration and conflict are on the rise, creating serious socio-economic and health challenges.\n\nTo effectively address these issues, we must strengthen our health systems, beginning with primary healthcare, which is foundational to building resilience. Under HE President Bola Tinubu’s @officialABAT #RenewedHope agenda and through the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal and Investment Initiative (#NHSRII), we are driving reforms to better equip our health sector. This includes revamping the health workforce, enhancing disease detection, and investing in sustainable infrastructure, such as the solarization of healthcare facilities. The recent floods underscored the critical importance of preparedness and rapid response to prevent outbreaks and safeguard public health.\n\nAddressing these challenges demands not only government leadership but also coordinated, multi-stakeholder partnerships. Our collaboration with international partners—including the World Bank @WorldBank, USAID @USAIDGH, and the UK government—under initiatives like the HOPE Project @projecthopeorg is strengthening our health systems. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that while Nigeria and other developing nations bear the brunt of climate change, we are not responsible for its root causes. This disparity places a disproportionate burden on vulnerable populations, making it a matter of social justice. Global efforts must respond with meaningful, not symbolic, investments.\n\nFurthermore, democratizing the climate conversation is essential. Climate change impacts must be understood not just by experts and policymakers, but by communities who are already experiencing its effects—shifts in weather, emerging diseases, and displacement. Public engagement and awareness are key to building a more resilient society capable of withstanding the climate challenges ahead.\n\nFinally, I extend my sincere appreciation to Vivian @VIhekweazu for providing this platform and for her leadership in advancing this important conversation. I also thank all of you for your active participation. Moving forward, collaboration and meaningful partnerships will be essential to ensuring we are equipped to address the climate and health challenges of today and tomorrow.\n\nThank you.\n\n#ClimateHealthNexusNG #FHC2024",

    "text": "It was exciting to launch Nigeria’s Second National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (#AMR) and the National Genomic Surveillance Strategy, alongside my senior colleague, former Minister of Health, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, and my current colleagues, the Honorable Ministers of Agriculture and Environment, Honorable Dr. Amos Magaji, Chair of the House Committee on Tertiary Health, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health, and the Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Dr. Jide Idris. Several of our partners were also present, including WHO, FAO, USAID, and many more. Their presence highlights our collective commitment to advancing Nigeria’s health security, a key pillar of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s @officialABAT #RenewedHope Agenda for improving the health of all Nigerians.\n\nThese two critical documents are pivotal to the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII), which focuses on building a resilient healthcare system, strengthening governance, and securing better health outcomes and health security. By addressing both current and future threats, these strategies position Nigeria as a leader in health security across Africa and globally.\n\nBoth the AMR National Action Plan and the National Genomic Surveillance Strategy are closely interconnected. The integration of genomic surveillance with our AMR efforts will strengthen our capacity to monitor bacterial pathogens and detect emerging threats before they spread widely. This synergy will enhance Nigeria’s role in the global fight against AMR while simultaneously improving our overall public health security.\n\nAMR presents an urgent global challenge, contributing to 4.7 million deaths in 2021 alone. Nigeria’s Second National Action Plan on AMR was developed through extensive collaboration and adopts a One Health approach, integrating human, animal, and environmental health. Given that 67% of antimicrobial use occurs in the animal sector, this plan is crucial for curbing AMR and promoting responsible antimicrobial use across all sectors. Support from mechanisms like the #PandemicFund will be essential in financing these efforts and ensuring that Nigeria is equipped to combat AMR effectively.\n\nThe National Genomic Surveillance Strategy is equally vital. Genomic technologies will revolutionize the way we detect, monitor, and respond to infectious diseases. By integrating genomics into our AMR surveillance systems, we will enhance our ability to track pathogens, anticipate future health threats, and advance precision medicine and public health interventions.\n\nLooking forward, Nigeria is positioning itself to host a high-level ministerial program on AMR within the next two years. We are in discussions to bring global leaders together in Nigeria to further advance our collective efforts in combating AMR. This will bolster efforts to enhance health security on the continent and beyond.\n\nWe appreciate the hard work of numerous experts who led deep stakeholder engagement to develop these strategic documents.\n\nWe also acknowledge the invaluable contributions of our development partners, including the World Health Organization @WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization @FAO, @USAID, DRASA Health Trust @drasatrust, and the Clinton Health Access Initiative @CHAI_health. Thank you all.\n\nThe real work begins tomorrow, and with the commitment of all stakeholders, I am confident that we will make significant strides in building a healthier, safer Nigeria—a Nigeria that plays its part in African and global health security.",

These diseases, often affecting the most vulnerable and neglected folks in our society, are a significant concern as we continue to implement Mr President’s @officialABAT goal of achieving improving quality health outcomes for all Nigerians under the #RenewedHope Agenda.\n\nNTDs such as onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis remain silent burdens on our communities, often overlooked because they affect those who have the least voice. Yet, it is these very diseases that we must address if we are to build a healthier, more prosperous Nigeria. The work being done under the Reaching the Last Mile initiative, supported by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan @mohamedbinzayed and the Gates Foundation @BillGates, is a testament to the power of collaboration in achieving this goal.\n\nOur discussions today reaffirmed the need to continue scaling up efforts. With a new $500 million global expansion of the RLM program over the next six years, this effort is poised to bring treatments and life-changing interventions to millions of people all over the world. \n\nI emphasized the importance of partnerships. While external support is vital, Nigeria must take ownership of responsibility for its health outcomes. Our government will continue to work closely with our partners, through the #SWAp, to ensure that no effort is wasted and every resource is directed where it is needed most. This is not just about receiving assistance; it’s about making sure we are building a system that can endure.\n\nLet’s continue this journey towards a healthier and more equitable Nigeria.",

This collaboration marks a major milestone in addressing the growing burden of non-communicable diseases #NCDs in Nigeria, especially cardiovascular conditions. Beyond initiating an impactful effort, it paves the way for over 250 indigent Nigerians to gain access to life-saving cardiac surgeries and interventions—offering genuine hope to those most in need.\n\nI extend my heartfelt congratulations to Dr. Yemi Johnson @yemij, Founder and CEO of First Cardiology Consultants, for his vision and commitment to addressing this critical healthcare challenge; to the Co-Founders of the Healthy Heart Foundation; and to Barrister Henry Odein Ajumogobia, SAN, OFR, @Oajumogobia, Chairman of FIRST E&P, for their strategic leadership. This partnership is a testament to how healthcare and corporate entities can unite to meet urgent health needs and unlock Nigeria’s vast human potential.\n\nThis initiative aligns perfectly with the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Initiative (#NHSRII), particularly in the areas of improving quality health outcomes and unlocking the health sector value chain @PVAC_NG. It underscores the need for a strong healthcare infrastructure, expanding access to high-quality care, and enhancing financial protection for Nigerians through health insurance. It also reflects the core of the #RenewedHope agenda championed by His Excellency, Mr. President @officialABAT, whose commitment to alleviating the physical and financial burdens on Nigerians is a driving force behind this effort.\n\nHowever, this partnership cannot stand alone. The rising tide of non-communicable diseases requires a collective response. I urge more private sector players, foundations, and philanthropic organizations to step up and collaborate with the government to ensure that high-quality healthcare becomes a right for every Nigerian, not a privilege. By combining our resources and expertise, we can magnify the impact of such initiatives, ensuring critical health services reach every corner of our nation.\n\nTogether, we can build a resilient and inclusive healthcare system—one that not only addresses the challenges of today but prepares for those of tomorrow. Let this partnership be a beacon, inspiring greater collaboration for the well-being of all Nigerians.",

    "text": "It was a sobering experience for me today as I returned to the 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐌𝐚𝐢𝐝𝐮𝐠𝐮𝐫𝐢 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐇𝐨𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥, along with His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Borno State, Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum @ProfZulum. This is my second visit since the devastating floods that ravaged the region four weeks ago. The destruction we witnessed remains extensive, but I am heartened by the resilience and dedication of everyone involved in the ongoing recovery efforts.\n\nOur visit today had three key objectives:\n\nFirst, to follow up on the successful deployment of medical relief interventions, including cholera vaccines, in response to the heightened risk due to the floods. The cholera vaccines have likely played a critical role in curbing the rising cases, and we are encouraged by the progress made, thanks to the collaborative efforts of the State Government and our development partners, including @WHO, @UNICEF, @gavi, @GlobalFund, the @gatesfoundation, @USPM, @msfbelgique, and many others.\n\nSecond, we aimed to assess the extent of damage to the teaching hospital’s infrastructure, with a special focus on the Radiodiagnostic and Cancer Centers, vital facilities that have been lifelines for thousands of patients in the region and beyond. It is crucial that these centers be restored to full operational capacity as swiftly as possible.\n\nLastly, we engaged with key stakeholders and partners to explore ways of mobilizing additional resources to expedite the rehabilitation efforts and ensure sustained recovery. I call on development partners, such as the Global Fund, to support the restoration of the Molecular Laboratory, which was submerged and lost important diagnostic equipment. Furthermore, I urge other actors to join the government in mobilizing the estimated nearly ₦20 billion required to fully restore the teaching hospital over time.\n\nIn line with Mr. President’s @officialABAT Renewed Hope Agenda, we are committed to restoring this facility quickly, ensuring it continues to save lives and reduce the suffering of our people.\n\nI was deeply moved by the generosity of the Borno State Government @BornoGovt, and specifically His Excellency Governor Prof. Babagana Zulum, who contributed a substantial and symbolic sum of ₦500 million towards the teaching hospital’s reconstruction. This significant gesture is a testament to the leadership and commitment of His Excellency and his team in prioritizing the restoration of healthcare services for the people of Borno. On behalf of the Federal Government @GovNigeria, I extend our sincere appreciation for this invaluable support.\n\nI would also like to acknowledge and commend the extraordinary leadership and dedication of 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐟. 𝐀𝐡𝐦𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐡𝐢𝐝𝐣𝐨, the Chief Medical Director of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital. His unwavering commitment to the institution, especially during these challenging times, has been exemplary. From the onset of the flooding, Prof. Ahidjo and his team have worked tirelessly, often under immense pressure, to ensure that the hospital remains operational and that patients continue to receive care. His efforts, along with those of the hospital management, are deeply appreciated and serve as a model of leadership in times of crisis.\n\nWe remain dedicated to supporting the recovery process. The Federal Ministry of Health @Fmohnigeria will continue to provide the necessary assistance, working closely with the State Government and development partners to mobilize additional resources for the complete restoration of the hospital and its facilities.",

    "text": "Today, at Redeemer’s University @RedeemersUni, Ede, Osun State, I was glad to commission the new Institute of Genomics and Global Health, marking a significant evolution from ACEGID’s @acegid status as a center of excellence. This moment is not only a proud achievement for all those involved, but it also stands as a powerful symbol of what African scientific leadership can achieve on the global stage. Under the visionary leadership of Prof Christian Happi @christian_happi, the team at ACEGID has made extraordinary strides in genomic research, particularly in addressing some of the most pressing infectious disease challenges of our time.\n\nThe inauguration of the Institute reminds us that the work being done by the ACEGID team is a global public good, benefiting not only Nigeria and Africa but also contributing to global health security. The partnerships fostered between institutions and scientists from the Global North and South are a testament to our shared commitment to protecting and advancing human health. This collaboration has demonstrated what is possible when we work together to confront challenges that affect us all.\n\nUnder the visionary leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, @officialABAT health security remains a central pillar of our broader strategy to transform Nigeria’s health system, unlock the value chain, and improve population health outcomes. This is why supporting cutting-edge scientific research, like the work at this Institute, is essential. We need to create a health system environment with strong public health capabilities to withstand the potential and evolving threats posed by infectious diseases and the ongoing impacts of climate change.\n\nThe pace at which new health threats are emerging is accelerating, and with it, the need for robust scientific responses. The innovations in genomics we are witnessing at ACEGID provide a glimmer of hope, offering us the tools we need to be better prepared for what may come. The Federal Government of Nigeria @NigeriaGov is fully committed to supporting these efforts, knowing that science must lead the way in securing a healthier future for all.",

By focusing on workforce development, research, and advancing our healthcare system, we are setting the stage for a generational milestone in Nigeria’s quality healthcare journey. Our collective efforts will shape the future of oncology care in the country, bringing hope and access to the most vulnerable.\n\nI want to take a moment to deeply appreciate 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐟 𝐖𝐚𝐥𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐧, Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy (@FinMinNigeria), Dr. Tolu Adewole, MD/CEO of MedServe (@MedservAfrica), and Mr. Aminu Umar-Sadiq, MD/CEO of NSIA, for their leadership in organizing this summit, as well as the Ministry of Finance and all partners for their unwavering support. Commendation also to the Honorable Minister of State for Health, Dr. Tunji Alausa @DrTunjiAlausa, and DG NICRAT, Prof. Usman Malami Aliyu, and their teams for their diligence in advancing oncological preventive and curative practice in Nigeria.\n\nTogether, we are building a healthcare system that will leave a lasting legacy, ensuring that no Nigerian faces cancer alone. This is a critical step in our ongoing journey to improve equitable and quality health outcomes for all. Let’s keep the momentum going as we work toward a healthier, stronger Nigeria.\n\n#OncologySummit #RenewedHopeAgenda #NHSRII #CancerCare #HealthcareTransformation #Nigeria",

We appreciate all health workers who are striving despite the obvious challenges we are facing as a country. However, the challenges are not insurmountable, as long as we keep the interest of Nigerians at heart and approach each other constructively.",

May Allah grant eternal peace to the soul of our departed leader and bless the reign of his successor in the Ningi Emirate.\n\nDuring my visit, I reflected on a key legacy of the late Emir, who had requested that the North East Vesico Vaginal Fistula (#VVF) Center be established in Ningi during President Jonathan’s tenure, while I was Minister of State.

The meeting, organized by the @NphcdaNG, was graced by the esteemed presence of Alhaji Aliko Dangote @AlikoDangote, Mr. Bill Gates @BillGates, and their respective teams.\n\nThe critical role played by traditional and religious leaders in safeguarding the health and well-being of our communities cannot be overstated. Over the past 15 years, the NTLC has been instrumental in advancing efforts to expand immunization and transform primary healthcare in Nigeria.\n\nOne of Nigeria’s key achievements in recent years is the successful eradication of the wild polio virus. This victory was made possible not only through medical interventions but also through the unwavering support and leadership of religious and traditional leaders, who mobilized communities and ensured that children received life-saving vaccines—a modern-day miracle.\n\nEqually, the Council has been pivotal in improving maternal and child health by advocating for safe childbirth practices and promoting access to prenatal and postnatal care. These efforts have led to healthier outcomes for mothers and children.\n\nThe Committee’s leadership in advocacy has enhanced routine immunization coverage, especially in remote and underserved areas, though there is still much work to be done to reduce the number of zero-dose children.\n\nPresident Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s @officialABAT administration, through the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal and Investment Initiative (#NHSRII), is committed to building on these successes by employing a sector-wide approach to enhance population health outcomes.\n\nI extend my deepest gratitude to His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto, 𝐌𝐮𝐡𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐝𝐮 𝐒𝐚’𝐚𝐝 𝐀𝐛𝐮𝐛𝐚𝐤𝐚𝐫 𝐂𝐅𝐑, all Royal Highnesses, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, the Dangote Foundation @AlikoDangoteFdn, Mr. Bill Gates, the Gates Foundation @gatesfoundation, and all our development partners, including @UNICEF_Nigeria, @WHONigeria, the Sultan Foundation, Chigarin Foundation @chigari_ngo, and others.

    "text": "This afternoon, HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR @officialABAT, in-Council, approved a landmark policy set to transform healthcare human resource management in Nigeria.\n\nThe National Policy on Health Workforce Migration addresses the critical challenges facing Nigeria’s health human resources.\n\nAs the AU @_AfricanUnion Champion for Human Resources for Health and Community Health Delivery Partnership, Mr President’s commitment to a resilient and robust healthcare system is powerfully reflected in this forward-looking policy.\n\nThis policy is more than just a response to the ongoing exodus of healthcare professionals; it’s a comprehensive strategy to manage, harness, and reverse health worker migration. It envisions a thriving workforce that is well-supported, adequately rewarded, and optimally utilized to meet the healthcare needs of all Nigerians.\n\nCentral to this vision is the Nigeria Human Health Resource Program, which sets a framework for regular reviews of working conditions, ensuring that health workers, especially in rural and underserved areas, receive the recognition and rewards they deserve. By fostering an environment conducive to professional growth and stability, the policy aims to retain top talent within Nigeria.\n\nIn an increasingly digital world, integrating advanced health technologies is essential. The policy’s focus on digital health infrastructure—including Electronic Medical Records (EMR), telehealth, and a comprehensive Health Workforce Registry—marks a significant step towards a more efficient, data-driven health system. These innovations will streamline healthcare delivery and enhance the equitable distribution of health workers, ensuring access to quality care for all Nigerians.\n\nCapacity building is at the heart of this policy. It recognizes the importance of continuous professional development, with strategic partnerships and opportunities for international training to equip our healthcare professionals with cutting-edge skills. This investment in human capital underscores our commitment to retaining and empowering our healthcare workforce.\n\nThe policy addresses the return and reintegration of Nigerian health professionals from the Diaspora. By establishing streamlined registration processes and providing attractive incentives, the policy not only encourages the return of our talented professionals but actively reintegrates them into our health system. This approach leverages the expertise of our diaspora to bridge gaps within the health sector.\n\nAlso, the policy champions reciprocal agreements with other nations to ensure that the exchange of health workers benefits Nigeria. These bilateral and multilateral agreements are designed to protect national interests while respecting the rights and aspirations of our healthcare professionals. We call on recipient countries to implement a 1:1 match—training one worker to replace every publicly trained Nigerian worker they receive.\n\nRecognizing the importance of work-life balance, the policy includes provisions for routine health checks, mental well-being support, and reasonable working hours, especially for younger doctors. These measures aim to create a supportive work environment, reducing burnout and enhancing job satisfaction.\n\nThe governance of this policy will be overseen by the National Human Resources for Health Program (#NHRHP) within @Fmohnigeria, in collaboration with state governments. This ensures responsible implementation and alignment with broader sector-wide (#SWAp) health objectives.\n\nWith this decisive action, the National Policy on Health Workforce Migration is set to secure the future of Nigeria’s healthcare system. Under Mr. President’s leadership, this policy will further catalyze the transformation of our health sector, ensuring access to quality healthcare for all Nigerians.\n\nAs we embark on this journey, all stakeholders are invited to contribute to building a healthcare system that reflects our nation’s potential and promise.",

    "text": "At Gwarimpa General Hospital today, the atmosphere was one of renewed hope and relief. Collaborating with FCT @OfficialFCTA Minister H.E. Nyesom Wike @GovWike and his team, led by Dr. Dolapo Fasawe, @drdolapofasawe the Mandate Secretary for Health, we advanced Mr. President’s @officialABAT agenda for improving the health of Nigerians.\n\nPregnant mothers were provided with multiple micronutrient supplements, crucial for their health and the healthy development of their babies. The federal government @NigeriaGov has mobilized millions of doses of these supplements, donated by Kirk Humanitarian Foundation @K_Humanitarian and UNICEF @UNICEF @UNICEF_Nigeria, ensuring that pregnant women across the country will receive them free of charge. Each bottle is sufficient for a pregnant woman to use for six months. This effort supports mothers and their unborn children, ensuring they emerge stronger and healthier.\n\nWe also distributed Mama Kits, containing essential items for safe deliveries. These kits include everything a mother needs to deliver safely, from sanitary items to medications that prevent malaria and other diseases. The government’s commitment to providing these items demonstrates our dedication to the health and safety of our mothers and their children.\n\nThe Gwarimpa General Hospital event also marked the introduction of the Medical Palliative Programme. I salute the FCT administration and encourage all subnational governments to emulate this initiative. The programme aims to alleviate the financial burden on families, allowing them to use their saved funds for other essential needs. Successfully implemented at Gwarimpa General Hospital, this programme will soon expand to other hospitals and primary health care facilities across the FCT, ensuring broader reach and impact.\n\nI also commend all the hardworking health professionals—doctors, pharmacists, nurses, lab scientists, community health workers, and other dedicated officials from the FCT Health Services and Environment Secretariat. Together, we are making significant strides toward ensuring that every Nigerian, especially the most vulnerable, has access to quality healthcare.\n\nThe Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative #NHSRII is on the move!",

    "text": "Today, we inaugurated the National Emergency Medical Treatment Committee (#NEMTC) and signing the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Rural Emergency Service and Maternal Transport (#RESMAT) scheme. This event marks a pivotal step in advancing our emergency medical services, ensuring timely and efficient care for all Nigerians, especially the most vulnerable.\n\nUnder the leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT, we have prioritized the health of Nigerians, unveiling initiatives like the Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) being implemented through the Sector-Wide Approach (#SWAp) program. These programs are designed to meet the needs of all Nigerians, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, by enhancing governance, improving health systems, unlocking value through public and private sector collaboration, and bolstering health security.\n\nThe #NEMTC, with oversight from distinguished professionals, will coordinate efforts to reduce maternal mortality and improve emergency medical response. The committee’s multi-stakeholder approach includes federal, state, and local governments, private sector partners, and international organizations like the World Bank @WorldBank, ensuring a coherent strategy to elevate our health sector.\n\nThe #RESMAT initiative, in collaboration with #NEMSAS, aims to provide efficient emergency transport and medical services in rural areas. By addressing delays in accessing care, especially for pregnant women, we strive to lower maternal mortality rates and enhance overall health outcomes. This initiative leverages the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (#BHCPF) to finance emergency services, ensuring quality and timely care.\n\nI would like to extend our appreciation to the key members who have made this possible: the Chairman of NEMTC, Dr Ismail Musa Jibrin; Professor Brisibe (Co-Chair, the Honorable Commissioner of Health of Bayelsa State); representatives from the National Blood Service Commission @MaltaNBS, National Health Insurance Agency @NhisNg, National Primary Health Care Development Agency @NphcdaNG, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control @NCDCgov, the Manager of NEMSAS within the Ministry @Fmohnigeria, the World Bank @WBG_Health, and all other esteemed members. Your dedication and collaboration are vital to the success of this initiative.\n\nToday’s inauguration and MoU signing reflect our unwavering commitment to a healthier Nigeria. We are building a robust emergency medical system that will save lives and improve the well-being of our citizens. Together, we will achieve a brighter, healthier future for all Nigerians.",

    "text": "Today, we had a very insightful discussion with the leadership of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (#ALGON ). We greatly appreciated their openness and constructive engagement.\n\nWe explored the critical role that local governments play in ensuring a well-functioning primary healthcare (#PHC) system in Nigeria.\n\nThe 2014 National Health Act (#NHA) envisions healthcare under one roof, establishing a national health system that delineates responsibilities across federal, state, and local levels. Local governments are crucial in providing basic health services that address common health challenges and promote preventive care.\n\nWe discussed the connection between the National Health Sector Reform Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) and the sector-wide Compact, which ensures coherence and collaboration among all levels of government.\n\nThe Compact is facilitating a coordinated approach to healthcare delivery, aligning efforts and resources to achieve common health goals. While local governments have been part of the Compact from the onset, recent developments have made their role even more robust and impactful.",

    "text": "We are excited to announce the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Global Gases Group, led by Mr. Deepak Mehta, to establish gas plants for the production of liquefied medical oxygen in Nigeria. This collaboration aims to ensure a steady and reliable supply of high-quality medical oxygen across the country.\n\nThis partnership is a game changer for Nigeria and the subregion and directly aligns with the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (#NHSRII) and the President’s @officialABAT @NigeriaGov Executive Order to unlock the healthcare value chain. The planned facilities, each capable of producing 100 tons per day, will be strategically located in 3 urban clusters located in North and South of Nigeria in the first phase. This will ensure that medical oxygen is accessible to a broader population, meeting both current and future demands.\n\nThe MoU outlines several key commitments from both parties. Global Gases Group (GGG) will complete feasibility studies and business case development, invest in technology, gas storage and distribution infrastructure, and provide necessary training and development for the project.\n\nUtilizing cryogenic air separation technology, these plants will offer a sustainable, affordable, accessible, and scalable (SAAS) solution for medical-grade oxygen production. This technology provides higher purity levels (>99.5%) and reliability compared to traditional methods.\n\nThe project will also lay the groundwork for a more resilient and responsive healthcare system capable of withstanding future challenges such as pandemics. \n\nImportantly, it will contribute to local skill development and job creation.\n\nReflecting on the #Covid_19 pandemic, many Nigerians and @CEDEAO_ECOWAS citizens suffered due to severe oxygen shortages.\n\nWe extend our heartfelt thanks to the leadership of Global Gases and Dr. Abdul Mukhtar @Dr_AbduMukhtar of the Presidential Value Chain Initiative (@PVAC_NG) for their pivotal roles in making this partnership a reality.",

    "text": "Is Corruption in Nigeria a problem of bad apples or a bad systems? This was the question I posed in my opening remarks at the Conference on “𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐮𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧-𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝐍𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚”, organized by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), @icpcnigeria in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare @Fmohnigeria today in Abuja. \n\nReflecting on my experience as an infectious disease physician and public health specialist, I likened corruption to an epidemic, spreading from person to person, embedded in worldviews, systems and institutions.\n\nRecent incidents, such as the reported pilfering of therapeutic foods meant for acutely malnourished children, in one of the States, underscore this issue. \n\nCorruption is not only a matter of individual bad actors but also a systemic problem that permeates different levels of governance, in varying degrees, from budget allocations to procurement processes and service delivery. It also includes private sector, civil society and communities condoning, enabling, or rejecting it.\n\nImproving population health outcomes for all Nigerians requires us to tackle these systemic issues head-on.\n\nThe approach adopted by the FMOHSW and its partners to reforming the health sector envisions a prosperous future for all Nigerians. Last December, we were mandated by H.E.President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR @officialABAT @GovNigeria to implement a Sector-Wide Approach (#SWAp) to eliminate fragmentation in health initiatives, fostering coordination and collaboration among all stakeholders. This approach ensures that health programs are delivered efficiently and effectively, reduce waste. \n\nGoing forward, the FMOHSW will collaborate very closely with the ICPC to enhance prevention of corrupt practices. We will revisit previous corruption risk assessments and system studies to identify gaps and areas for improvement. \n\nWe are setting up a Joint task team, comprising members of the FMOHSW’s anti-corruption unit and the ICPC representatives, will develop an anti-corruption program, especially around the #BHCPF direct facility financing at PHCs @NphcdaNG @NhisNg and use of the vulnerable groups fund, while preserving and respecting ICPC’s independent role. \n\nEnhanced monitoring mechanisms will oversee the flow of funds and resource utilization at the primary health care level, including hotlines and web portals for reporting irregularities. We will engage with civil society and local communities to foster transparency and accountability, deterring corrupt practices and encouraging more ethical behavior. \n\nAdditionally, we will invest in capacity building and training programs for health workers and regulatory bodies to ensure they are equipped to uphold their professional standards. We call on all 36 States @NGFSecretariat, FCT @OfficialFCTA and the 774 Local Governments to join us in efforts to strengthen the integrity fiduciary systems in health institutions. To the private sector and civil society, we also put you on notice and ask that you join hands in the effort. \n\nI extend my heartfelt gratitude to the ICPC Chairman, 𝐃𝐫. 𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐚 𝐀𝐝𝐚𝐦𝐮 𝐀𝐥𝐢𝐲𝐮, SAN, and the entire ICPC leadership and my colleagues at FMOHSW for organizing this timely and vital conference. Your dedication to this cause is commendable, and I urge all other stakeholders to join in this crucial collaboration to end corruption in the health sector. Together, we can make a significant impact and pave the way for a healthier and more prosperous Nigeria.",

    "text": "It was a great honor for me today to deliver a keynote address at the 5th Annual Legislative Summit on Health organized by the Senate Committee on Health in Abuja. The forum provided an invaluable platform to share the journey the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has embarked upon, in line with the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Tinubu @officialABAT, to transform Nigeria’s healthcare system through the Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative (HSRII). Thank you, H.E. Sen. Dr Ipalibo Harry Banigo @HarryBanigo, for your leadership in convening the Summit.\n\nAt the very onset of our transformative journey for the nation’s health sector, in collaboration with  Prof Margaret Kruk @mkruk and her team at Harvard T.H. Chan School @HarvardChanSPH, we harnessed insights from the People’s Voices Survey of 2,500 Nigerians to have an understanding of the healthcare experiences and expectations of our people.\n\nWe listened to concerns regarding healthcare access, affordability and quality. Many Nigerians struggled to access necessary quality medical services due to cost barriers, and there is a notable increase in non-communicable diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, and cancers, alongside persistent traditional health issues like maternal and child health, malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the HSRII was developed and unveiled by Mr President in 2023. This initiative is structured around four critical pillars: governance, improving population health outcomes, unlocking the healthcare value chain, and health security. The raison d’être of the HSRII is to address systemic issues, optimize resource utilization, and ensure that all Nigerians have access to quality healthcare.\n\nSignificant successes have already been achieved under the Initiative. We have made substantial progress in improving governance through the signing of a Compact with all 36 state governors and the FCT; and 17 development partners to work collectively as a National Health System. The Compact has facilitated better coordination and alignment of efforts across all levels of Government, ensuring that resources are utilized efficiently and fragmentation kept in check.\n\nOn improving population health outcomes, we are on track to expand functional primary healthcare centers. Already, we have conducted two rounds of disbursements through the BHCPF, ensuring resources reach the front lines. Additionally, we are retraining 120,000 frontline health workers to enhance their skills and service delivery capabilities, with 7,000 workers already retrained in the 36 States. \n\nUnlocking the healthcare value chain is essential to reducing our dependency on imports. Currently, Nigeria imports 70% of the pharmaceutical generics and 99% of our medical devices. To address this, few weeks ago, Mr President signed an Executive Order to reduce tariffs on imports of raw materials and manufacturing equipment, encouraging local production and making our healthcare system more self-reliant.\n\nHealth security is a matter of national, economic, and global security. The COVID-19 pandemic and previous outbreaks like Ebola have underscored the importance of robust health security measures. We’re strengthening @NCDCgov, improving surveillance systems, and maintaining strategic stockpiles to ensure rapid response to health emergencies. Our swift and effective response to recent public health emergencies, such as meningitis and cholera outbreaks, demonstrates our commitment to protecting public health.\n\nI want to extend my deep gratitude, once again, to the Chairman of @NGRSenate Committee on Health, Sen. Dr. Banigo, and other distinguished members of the Senate and the leadership of the House of Reps and their Committees, for their unwavering support and collaboration from the outset\n\nAs we move forward, I call for continued dedication to supporting the President’s Renewed Hope Agenda. Together, we can achieve improved health outcomes for all Nigerians.",

    "text": "It was a momentous occasion today for Nigeria’s health sector renewal as we commissioned several projects and ground breaking at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital’s Permanent Site. This milestone celebrates the significant progress that has been made in advancing healthcare infrastructure by the Federal Government in collaboration with various private sector leaders and the Anambra State government @anambrastate_.\n\nThe permanent site features a nearly 2000-bed capacity with state-of-the-art facilities such as a 240-bed Trauma and Emergency Complex, a 200-bed Pediatrics Emergency Complex, a 200-bed Medical Ward Complex, a 120-bed Mother and Childcare Building, a Radiology Building, and a General Outpatient Department Complex. The site also includes two oxygen plants, ensuring high-quality healthcare delivery.\n\nThe projects included the Dr. Cletus Ibeto General Outpatient Department (GOPD) Complex, Sir Emeka Offor Medical Ward Complex, and the Sen. Dr. Ifeanyi Uba Medical Outpatient Clinic. It included several specialized clinics and complexes: the Dr. TOK Osuafor Medical Outpatient Clinics, Prof. SNC Anyanwu General Surgery Clinics, Prof. JC Orakwe Urology Clinics, Prof. Ifeoma Egbuonu Children Emergency Complex, Prof. TO Ulasi Children Outpatient Clinic, Prof. OC Ikpeze Antenatal/VIP Clinic, Prof. JIB Adinma Antenatal Clinic, and the Prof. OC Okpala Radiology Complex.\n\nThe successful completion of these projects highlights the power of a partnership approach in transforming Nigeria’s health sector. We must commend Sir Emeka Offor, for single-handedly funding the Medical Ward Complex, showcasing his unwavering commitment to healthcare and social welfare. Dr. Cletus Ibeto, CON, has also shown extraordinary generosity in establishing the General Outpatient Department (GOPD) Complex. Equally, the distinguished Sen. Dr. Ifeanyi Ubah @Dr_IfeanyiUbah has played a crucial role in mobilizing the Anambra Progressives for funding the Medical Outpatient Clinic. Their remarkable support and dedication are testaments to the impact of collective effort and the importance of involving all segments of society in healthcare development.\n\nUnder the leadership of HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR @officialABAT, the Federal Government, through the Renewed Hope Agenda, is committed to delivering improved quality health outcomes for all Nigerians. The construction of access roads by the state government and the substantial investments by industry leaders exemplify the whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach necessary to achieve these goals. \n\nHealth is a fundamental asset for the nation, and investing in it ensures that our people can work, trade, and contribute towards building a prosperous nation.\n\nI used the opportunity to also commend Prof. Joseph Ugboaja, OON, the CMD, and his team, who strategically adopted a 10-year strategic and development plan aimed at positioning NAUTH to be among the top three health facilities in Nigeria by 2030. These efforts fully align with the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative.\n\nIt was a great delight to also see dedicated health workers and professionals in action. Despite the numerous challenges we are facing as a country, the dedication of Nigeria’s healthcare workforce offers a glimmer of hope that, working together, putting the Nigerian people at core of our attention, we can indeed overcome all challenges. Thank you!",

The warm reception and hospitality extended to us is deeply appreciated and set the tone for a collaborative and productive engagement.\n\nWe discussed the importance of strong governance, transparency, and accountability in healthcare. These are vital for delivering the health outcomes our citizens deserve. The Renewed Hope Agenda focuses on expanding healthcare access and infrastructure to ensure quality services for all Nigerians.\n\nGovernor Soludo’s initiatives, including expanding primary health care, developing a pharmaceutical manufacturing hub, align with our goals. The recent Presidential Executive Order waiving tariffs on pharmaceutical production will support local manufacturers, creating jobs and ensuring essential medicines are available and affordable over time.\n\nWe emphasized health security and the need for a robust readiness and response to health emergencies. Collaborative efforts with the @NCDCgov and state governments will be crucial for protecting public health.\n\nGovernor Soludo’s commitment to primary healthcare is evident in the state’s efforts to establish functional health centers in all 326 wards. The free maternal and child healthcare initiative has benefited over 60,000 individuals with zero mortality. His focus on water, sanitation, and waste management is foundational for public health, significantly enhancing living conditions and health outcomes.\n\nThis visit has reinforced my belief in the importance of collaboration between federal, state, and local governments. By working together, we can unlock the full potential of the healthcare value chain, drive economic growth, and improve the quality of life for all Nigerians. This is the direction HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT is taking the nation with the Renewed Hope Agenda.",

This  marks a bold and hopeful step towards transforming our health system through the Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative and the Sector-Wide Approach, emphasizing the cooperative federalism mandated by the National Health Act of 2014.\n\nOur goal is to foster shared responsibility and collaboration among all health providers across various levels of government, the private sector, and our invaluable development partners. This dialogue is affirms our unwavering commitment to improving population health outcomes for all Nigerians.\n\nWe are grateful for the steadfast support of our development partners, who ensure that resources are directed towards priority areas that will significantly enhance health outcomes for our citizens. This is not just about cooperation; it is about accountability and collective progress. We have agreed to hold each other accountable, learn together, and work together through regular performance dialogues and evaluations.\n\nAt the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare @Fmohnigeria, we have committed to achieving several key indicators: improving Penta 3 coverage, increasing the proportion of fully immunized children, reducing the number of zero-dose children, enhancing the proportion of deliveries attended by skilled birth attendants, improving antenatal care coverage, and increasing access to health insurance and primary healthcare services. We are also committed to tracking the utilization rates of various services and the satisfaction of our population. We encourage states to track their progress against these indicators.\n\nI extend my heartfelt gratitude to everyone participating in this dialogue and all who have rallied around this initiative. Special thanks to the SWAp Coordination Office, the Minister of State @DrTunjiAlausa, the Permanent Secretary, and other colleagues at the Ministry. I also commend Dr. Banji Filani @okeanaye for his remarkable leadership of the Hon Commissioners’ Forum and all the Commissioners who have constructively co-created this mechanism. I am hopeful and confident that the 774 local governments will also join this effort to collectively improve the health of Nigerians, in line with the President’s @officialABAT Renewed Hope Agenda and the Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative. Together, we can achieve a healthier, stronger Nigeria.",

    "text": "This evening, at the Launch of the Private Sector Strategy to End Tuberculosis in Nigeria held in Lagos by the @StopTBNigeria, the message was clear: we know the statistics, we are leading in case identification, and the Government and its development partners are doing their part. Now, it’s time for the private sector to join the fight against tuberculosis in Nigeria.\n\nTuberculosis remains a formidable challenge in our country, striking the poorest and most vulnerable, those who are often socially excluded. Despite our progress, we still face significant hurdles. The resources needed to sustain and expand our efforts are vast, and the burden on our health system is immense. This isn’t just a health issue; it’s a social and economic challenge that affects directly or indirectly every one of us.\n\nIn inviting the private sector into the fight against tuberculosis, we seek active partners who can amplify our efforts. We have the tools and knowledge to combat TB effectively, but we need your support. Imagine the impact of a strategic partnership where the Nigerian private sector leaders raise $25 million USD for tuberculosis initiatives, and the government and development partners match it. Together, we can ensure that our resources are used efficiently, effectively, and transparently, with a plan to monitor our progress over time.\n\nThe First Lady of Nigeria, Senator Oluremi Tinubu @SenRemiTinubu, and the First Lady of Lagos State, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu @JokeSanwoolu, along with other First Ladies, have championed the fight against tuberculosis. Their leadership and advocacy have brought much-needed attention to this critical issue, inspiring action across all sectors of society. We also owe a great deal to our development partners, such as @USAIDGH and the Stop TB Partnership Nigeria, Agbami Parties, @GlobalFund, @UNOPS, @USAIDGH, @KncvNigeria, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria, and other partners whose unwavering support, resources, and expertise have significantly advanced our efforts.\n\nA long-standing friend and global public health icon, Prof. Peter Piot, has been a tremendous influence on our strategies against TB. His pioneering work, dedication to global health, and insightful guidance have been instrumental in shaping effective TB strategies. His leadership and commitment continue to inspire and drive us forward.\n\nAs a strong and willing coalition, we can eradicate tuberculosis from Nigeria in line with our goal to save lives and produce health for all Nigerians under President @officialABAT Renewed Hope Agenda for improved quality health outcomes. This is the spirit and essence of Stop TB Partnership @StopTB.",

    "text": "In a transformative move to revitalize the Nigerian health sector, His Excellency President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR @officialABAT, has signed an Executive Order aiming to increase local production of healthcare products (pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, devices such as needles and syringes, biologicals, medical textile, etc.). The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation @FedMinOfJustice, Prince Lateef Olasunkanmi Fagbemi SAN, @LOFagbemi, is to now take the next steps towards codifying the new Order. \n\nThe Order is pivotal to the success of the Initiative for Unlocking the Health Care Value Chain (@PVAC_NG), which was approved in October 2023 by the President. \n\nThe Order introduces zero tariffs, excise duties and VAT on specified machinery, equipment and raw materials, aiming to reduce production costs and enhance our local manufacturers’ competitiveness. Specified items  include Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (#APIs), excipients, other essential raw materials required for manufacturing of crucial health products like drugs, syringes and needles, Long-lasting Insecticidal Nets (#LLINs) and Rapid Diagnostic Kits, among others. \n\nThe Order also provides for establishing market shaping mechanisms such as framework contracts and volume guarantees, to encourage local manufacturers.\n\nThe Order mandates collaboration between the Ministers of Health @Fmohnigeria, Finance @FinMinNigeria, and Industry, Trade and Investment @TradeInvestNG to develop a Harmonized Implementation Framework, expediting regulatory approvals and reducing bottlenecks. Agencies including the Nigeria Customs Service @NgCustoms, @NafdacAgency, @SONNigeria, and @FIRSNigeria will ensure swift implementation, with special waivers and exemptions effective for two years.\n\nThe implication of this order is pivot towards market-based incentives to encourage medical industrialization, reducing costs of medical products through import substitution over time, creating and retaining economic value and enabling job creation in the healthcare value chain.\n\nWe thank Mr President for his courage and commitment to ensure Nigeria is put back on the path to prosperity. We also thank all who contributed to the ideas that culminated in the consensus that resulted in this key milestone.",

Eliminating malaria is critical to achieving to this vision. \n\nTogether, we can make significant strides in reducing the malaria burden. We will soon develop a costed strategic plan to make necessary trade offs explicit (thanks to Malaria Control and Elimination Partnership in Africa (MACEPA) / Clinton Health Access Initiative @CHAI_health), expand case management through an appropriately domesticated version of the AMFm experience with the lessons learned, optimize available tools (LLINs, SCM, IPT, LSM, R21 at appropriate time, phase and scale), with proper subnational tailoring, improve effectiveness of campaigns, good data systems, community engagement, local manufacturing of commodities, and adaptation to impact of climate change. Complementary support of State Governments will be essential to ensuring success. So also is private sector and civil society participation.\n\nSincere appreciation to the AMEN and Task Force members, and reiterating the Federal Government’s commitment to put Nigeria on track towards elimination in the years ahead.",

    "text": "Today, I was proud to inaugurate the “NHIA Fistula Free Program Flag-off and Inaugural Meeting,” marking a pivotal step in our commitment to tackling the severe healthcare challenge posed by obstetric fistula in Nigeria. Obstetric fistula affects approximately 100,000 women nationwide and results from prolonged and obstructed labor without timely medical intervention leading to unpleasant outcomes. The condition causes chronic incontinence and severe social and economic consequences, particularly for young, malnourished women from poor households. Each year, about 13,000 new cases arise, and without intervention, it could take up to 83 years to address the backlog of unrepaired cases.\n\nGlobally, obstetric fistula affects roughly 2 million women, with about 1 million cases in developing countries. This highlights the urgent need for comprehensive healthcare solutions, and Nigeria’s significant share of this burden underscores the critical importance of targeted interventions and robust healthcare policies.\n\nIn line with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR @officialABAT Administration’s prioritization of reproductive and maternal health, we are committed to ensuring no one is left behind. This commitment aligns with our broader goal of building an inclusive health system that reduces maternal morbidity and mortality and addresses the needs of the most vulnerable populations. The Fistula Free Program is a testament to this commitment, aiming to enhance financial access to care for women suffering from obstetric fistula.\n\nThe initial phase targets National Obstetric Fistula Centers in Katsina, Bauchi, Ebonyi, and Edo States, with plans to expand to other hospitals. It covers conservative and surgical treatments, transportation, education, counseling, mental health support, and family planning. A key component is enrolling these women in social health insurance programs to ensure the sustainability of care.\n\nThe Program is closely tied to the National Health Sector Reform Initiative #NHSRII and other key government initiatives aimed at making treatment affordable and accessible. Importantly, the program’s focus on reducing physical and financial pain and saving lives for affected families aligns with the overarching goals of the NHSRII @Fmohnigeria. By prioritizing financial access to care and integrating services into the social health insurance system, the program aims to create a sustainable and inclusive healthcare solution.\n\nThe MoU we signed is critical to formalize  the collaborative effort between the NHIA, National Obstetric Fistula Centers, and selected HMOs to ensure a coordinated and effective approach to addressing obstetric fistula across Nigeria. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of each party and sets a framework for the committee’s tasks. \n\nThe Committee will be action-oriented and results-driven in providing strategic guidance and direction, reviewing progress, making recommendations for improvement, advocating for prevention, and evaluating impact. These roles are crucial in ensuring that the program achieves its objectives and delivers tangible results for the affected women.\n\nI would like to extend my gratitude to Dr, Kelechi Ohiri, the DG, @NhisNg and all the individuals and agencies involved in this process as well as the membership of the steering committee. Their dedication and collaborative efforts are crucial in driving this initiative forward, ensuring it is action-oriented and results-driven.\n\nThis Fistula Free Program, backed by the unwavering commitment of President Tinubu to reproductive and maternal health, represents a transformative step towards addressing obstetric fistula in Nigeria. As we move forward, the collaborative efforts of all stakeholders will be essential in significantly reducing the burden of this condition, improving health outcomes, and ultimately saving lives. The work we undertake today sets the foundation for a healthier and more equitable future for all Nigerians.",

By doing so, they deliver quality care and enhance health outcomes.\n\nToday, I was honored to receive, on behalf of my colleagues at the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, @Fmohnigeria, a plaque of excellence from the leadership of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives @NANNM_NGR in commemoration of the 2024 International Nurses Week and Midwives Celebration. \n\nThis year’s theme, “Our Nurses: Our Future. The Economic Power of Care,” captures the essence of the invaluable roles these professionals play in ensuring the health and well-being of Nigerians while highlighting their critical economic impact.\n\nMost importantly, the theme aligns with the unwavering commitment of His Excellency, President Bola Tinubu, GCFR (@officialABAT), to the development of health resources. This is evident not only in his role as the African Union (@_AfricanUnion) Champion for Human Resources for Health and Community Health Delivery but also in his broader efforts to enhance health infrastructure and services.\n\nAs we celebrated the International Nurses Week 2024, we reaffirmed our commitment to strengthening our healthcare system under the #NHSRII by investing in nurses and midwives, to work within the extended family of healthcare professionals in the service of Nigerians. Together we can harness the economic power of healthy population to build a more prosperous Nigeria.",

    "text": "Nigeria is unfortunately grappling with a significant malnutrition crisis, ranking among the countries with the highest burden of malnutrition globally. This crisis is concentrated mostly in the northwest and northeast, although no region is completely spared. \n\nThe underlying reasons for this situation are multifaceted, including the nature of governance over several years, population dynamics with high dependency in the context of mass poverty in parts of the north, coupled with insecurity in certain areas—although it is improving—the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity and food systems, feeding practices, and the societal economic disempowerment of girls and women.\n\nAccording to recent UNICEF reports, approximately 2 million children suffer from severe acute malnutrition (#SAM), with 40% of these cases concentrated in six states. More than 6 million children are moderately malnourished, and many women (pregnant and lactating) suffer from micronutrient deficiencies.\n\nIn line with the Renewed Hope Agenda of Mr. President @officialABAT, we are now facing this crisis head-on. Addressing malnutrition is not only a moral imperative but also essential for improving health and ensuring the nation’s sustainable development.\n\nOur inter-ministerial and multi-partner meeting today was convened to assess ongoing efforts to tackle this crisis effectively. We appreciate the contributions of @UNICEF, @MSF, the @WorldBank, @WFP,  @RESCUEorg, BMGF @gatesfoundation, @fhi360, and several others who joined my colleagues from the government. We are encouraged by the potential to immediately unlock $30 million from the World Bank’s #ANRIN project, as well as a potential 1:1 match from the Child Nutrition Fund.\n\nWe have established a ministerial task force to quickly develop a realistic yet ambitious action plan, focusing on immediate resource mobilization and practical actions to deliver solutions to those who need them most. This plan takes into account the substantial burden on girls and women alongside children.\n\nEnhanced coordination is crucial, along with a strong bias for action. We will monitor progress and ensure accountability in deploying urgent interventions, including the distribution of micronutrient powders, therapeutic foods, and other nutritional supplements.\n\nWe will harness local production of therapeutic foods and other community-based interventions, strengthening and extending beyond the 1,192 treatment sites already in operation, mostly in primary healthcare centers.\n\nWe call on State Governments @NIGERIAGOVNORS, to also be on heightened alert, complement the efforts of various agencies in their respective states, and provide additional resources to manage this difficult phase. There is light at the end of the tunnel, and Nigeria will get through it with the steady, courageous leadership of HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR.",

Urging all involved to carefully consider the implications of undermining Nigeria’s progress on UHC for narrow and very short term interests. \n\nThe reforms will expand coverage for civil servants (including through a properly established and appropriately regulated Federal Civil Service HMO, coverage for retirees, at same time as expand protection for millions of poor and vulnerable Nigerians, not only for the Federal Civil Servants. \n\nhttps://t.co/Q5Lx723EQA",

Today, I had the honor, on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria and President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR @officialABAT, of welcoming distinguished Health Ministers and esteemed guests to the 25th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Health Ministers of the Economic Community of West African States @ecowas_cedeao, held in Abuja.\n\nThe theme of our meeting, “Quality of Health Care in the ECOWAS Region,” underscores the importance of both robust health systems and financial frameworks, as well as the need for trained, retained, and motivated frontline health workers to deliver services. We understand that access to care is only one part of the equation; without quality, access will not lead to improved health outcomes.\n\nI would like to extend my gratitude to fellow Health Ministers from our subregion and our technical partners for the robust deliberations. I also wish to acknowledge my brother, Dr. Jean Kaseya @JeanKaseya2, for his ongoing commitment and collaboration in strengthening health security in West Africa and across the continent. The agreement we signed today with the @AfricaCDC to establish a regional collaborative center will complement existing efforts, through the ECOWAS Regional Center for Disease Surveillance and Control @Ecowas_cdc, to detect, prevent, and respond to public health threats.\n\nOnce again, we have today demonstrated the power of our unity and shared purpose. Together, we can overcome the challenges before us and achieve lasting improvements in the health of our region. Let us leverage our collective strengths to create a healthier, more prosperous future for all.",

Our vision for Nigeria involves a robust healthcare system where public and private sectors collaboratively deliver high-quality services and products. These efforts not only save lives and protect our population but also create quality, well-paying jobs that offer growth opportunities.\n\nToday, I had the privilege to engage with esteemed leaders, partners, and stakeholders from the public and private sectors, discussing a shared goal: unlocking Nigeria’s healthcare value chain through partnerships. The goal was provide invaluable insights into the ways Nigeria can transform its healthcare system, improve health outcomes, and drive inclusive economic growth through accelerating equitable access to quality-assured health products.\n\nNigeria’s health sector faces challenges such as high import dependency, limited local manufacturing, and financial barriers, including high capital costs and restrictive market regulations. In line with President Tinubu’s @officialABAT promise to unlock the healthcare value chains, we are actively addressing these issues through policy reforms, regulatory improvements, and expanded access to capital. \n\nOur endeavors extend to strengthening the entire medical industry, from enhancing efficient and effective pharmaceutical regulation to increasing local production and improving access to healthcare financing. We aim to transform the health insurance landscape, potentially increasing coverage from 17 million to, over time, more tens of millions of Nigerians, which would dramatically change the demand dynamics for healthcare services. \n\nWe are also proud to share that significant investments are being made to expand our capacity in essential pharmaceutical and biological products. \n\nI extend my gratitude to His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Lagos State @jidesanwoolu, esteemed federal government leaders, and representatives from the @IFC_org, @AfDB_Group, @UNITAID , @afreximbank ,and other notable organizations—many of whom are long-standing colleagues—for their impressive attendance. I especially salute Dr. @Dr_AbduMukhtar, Coordinator of the @PVAC_NG, and his team for their tireless work on this initiative and for organizing this forum.\n\nNigeria is ready to embrace a vibrant and prosperous future, where the healthcare sector plays a pivotal role in growth and development. We invite local and international partners to invest in this sector. Through collaboration, we will build a healthcare system that ensures access to quality care while also generating significant economic value.",

The threat of infectious diseases is a constant reality, reminding us of the urgency of preparedness and having a rapid response mechanism.\n\nIt was my pleasure, this morning, to open the National Dialogue on Nigeria’s Pandemic Fund Application to craft a coherent proposal that Nigeria can present to the global pandemic fund negotiations.\n\nUnder Mr. President’s @officialABAT Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative #NHSRII, we’re committed to enhancing our detection and response capabilities to prevent small outbreaks from becoming larger crises as a key pillar of our Agenda.\n\nThe Pandemic Fund represents a critical resource in our arsenal to combat health threats. While it is not the only tool available, it is a significant one that can help facilitate the cross-sectoral collaboration necessary to address complex health challenges effectively. \n\nA recent study showed the presence of potential pandemic pathogens in fruit bats in an urban area, underscoring the importance of our #OneHealth approach and collaboration across ministries. This finding is a stark reminder of the lurking threats and the need for vigilance.\n\nThank you, Dr. Olajide Idris, DG @NCDCgov, for organizing the timely dialogue. And to my colleagues in Government, and development partners, for your continued commitment to Nigeria’s health security. Together, we’d mobilize resources, strengthen our systems, and ensure a unified national response. Our aim is clear: build a sustainable, resilient health infrastructure for Nigeria.",

I urge all federal and sub-national governments, along with our partners, to conduct mini-launches in each state. This will help tailor the data and strategies to local contexts, thereby expanding nutritional education and diversifying diets.",

This year’s Safe Motherhood Day calls us to action, reaffirming our dedication to end the loss of life due to maternal causes.\n\nThis year’s National Safe Motherhood Day is more than a celebration—it’s a call to action. We remember the almost  57,000 women who lost their lives to maternal causes in the last year and reaffirm our commitment to reducing these numbers to through improved primary care and community engagement.\n\nThe Administration of HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT is committed to putting the Nigerian people at the center of all initiatives, ensuring that every policy and investment improves the well-being of our citizens. Central to this agenda is enhancing healthcare access and outcomes, particularly for mothers and newborns.\n\nLast December, we launched the Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative as a collaborative sector-wide effort with all 36 state governors, the FCT Minister, development partners, and the CSOs, aimed at revamping delivery of basic health services. The Compact we signed to implement the NHSRII focuses on creating a cohesive, effective approach to healthcare, especially maternal newborn and child health.\n\nThe recent approval of 25 billion naira under the BHCPF, to be implemented through the NPHCDA and NHIA gateways, aims to enhance more than 8,000 BHCPF facilities, with ambitions to expand them to over 17,000 in the next three years. This Fund is the cornerstone of our strategy to ensure universal access to primary healthcare.\n\nWith the goal of “Investing in Maternal Health for a Sustainable Future,” under the slogan “Mother Lives, Child Thrives,” we call on all stakeholders to collaborate with us in achieving our fervent mission to ensure that no woman dies from pregnancy and childbirth-related conditions. We are deploying resources, domestically and through our partners, to ensure that every newborn is protected and supported to thrive into healthy childhood.\n\nOur commitment to strengthening primary healthcare remains unwavering. We have already started the retraining 120,000 frontline health workers and improving emergency obstetric services. we are working to ensure that every citizen receives quality care over time.\n\nAlso, as part of 2024 Safe Motherhood Day, I’m proud to launch the Guidelines for the Management of Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) at the community and health facility to accelerate the reduction of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. We will also support the local production of calibrated drapes and magnesium sulphate to ensure each pregnant woman has access to one calibrated drape.\n\nWe’d not achieve these milestones without the steadfast support of our development partners. So, I’d like to commend the efforts of the Safe Motherhood Sub-TWG and its partners, including the @WHO, @UNFPA, @UNICEF, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation @gatesfoundation, @PPFNigeria, @USAIDGH, Pathfinder International @pathfindershq, MCG/@Jhpiego , IPAS @IpasOrg, TA-connect @TAConnect_NG, Clinton Health Access Initiative @CHAI_health, @SCIDaR_ , @SFHNigeria, @PlanGlobal, @WRAglobal, RMCH Rotary International @Rotary, and Marie Stopes International Organization Nigeria, @msichoicesng, among others, for their support.\n\nYour collaboration and dedication are vital as we work together to enhance healthcare services across Nigeria. Together, we are setting a strong foundation for a healthier future, demonstrating we can create a future where every mother and newborn receives the care and support they need to thrive.\n\nLet’s keep up the momentum and continue to make health a priority. We are on this journey together, for a healthier, more prosperous Nigeria.\n#HealthForAll #RenewedHopeAgenda #SafeMotherhood #NHSRII #BHCPF #PrimaryHealthcare #HealthcareInnovation",

This is as it should be considering the exploding consequences of incidence of non-communicable diseases from these products.\n\nIndeed, there may be connections between environmental exposure to chemicals, adulterated substances, and the distribution of unregulated foods and drugs, with the increase in diseases such as cancers, hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease. \n\nAnd on the side of unlocking health care value chain, this could negatively impact our efforts, because if we don't have a well regulated system, we won’t be able to attract or retain veritable  investors or manufacturers as the counterfeit flow will undermine them. \n\nGoing forward, we are ramping up collaborative efforts between the federal government and states, recognizing the decentralized  system we operate as a country. This is in addition to strengthening NAFDAC, federal and state task forces to address environmental and food safety issues.\n\nLeveraging the Sector-Wide Approach, we will seek collaborations and support from international organizations such as the Global Fund, @GlobalFund, to enhance regulatory capacity.\n\nOn our part, through the strong commitment of Mr President @officialABAT, we will continue to prioritize effective governance of the health sector and, within available resources, try to secure adequate funding, including budget allocation for effective regulation nationwide.",

    "text": "Nigeria’s healthcare sector is experiencing a transformation under President Tinubu’s @officialABAT, leadership, with the approval of a Sector-Wide Approach (#SWAp) and the Health Sector Renewal Program (NHSRIP).\n\nKey reforms are underway for the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund (#BHCPF), including guideline reviews and governance structure enhancements.\n\nOur aim is to improve primary healthcare accessibility for vulnerable groups and reduce the need for patients to travel for care.\n\nIn a productive week during the holy month of Ramadan and Easter, we held the Ministerial Oversight Committee (#MOC) meeting on March 28 to discuss advancing Nigeria’s primary healthcare delivery through SWAp.\n\nAn assessment of the BHCPF highlighted the need for programmatic, operational, and fiduciary reforms.\n\nAll 36 states and the FCT have committed to addressing these issues through a remediation plan and a compact signed with the Federal Government.\n\nOur objective is to enhance the health of Nigerians through efficient, effective, and quality primary healthcare.\n\nAt the MOC, we approved the release of 25 billion Naira to the National Primary Health Care Development Agency @NphcdaNG, and the National Health Insurance Authority, @NhisNg, from the BHCPF.\n\nAs an interim measure, while developing BHCPF 2.0, we approved half of the available funds to the States via the Gateways.\n\nThe redesigned BHCPF aims to align resources towards improving health outcomes, with a focus on maternal and child health. We anticipate significant additional investments to be channeled to the primary healthcare system once the redesign is completed by July 1, 2024.\n\nThe revised guidelines will prioritize vulnerable groups, aiming to reduce maternal mortality rates and out-of-pocket payments. They will also standardize quality of care measures across primary healthcare facilities.\n\nSpecifically, on the NPHCDA gateway, among others, the guidelines revision will include increasing direct facility financing in a tiered way to address health inequities, provide additional resources for supervision by States, support for frontline health workers, and drugs/commodities at the #PHC levels (more than 8,000 PHCs across the country), and strengthen financial management and accountability.\n\nWe are counting on citizens and civil society organizations and the media to keep a close watch on the resources once they start to flow to each BHCPF-supported PHC facility, to ensure they are used for intended purposes only.\n\nWe are providing a dedicated email address (bhcpfalert@health.gov.ng) and a dedicated phone line published on the website of the Federal Ministry of Health and other public portals, so that any citizen or civil society organization can report information on the potential misuse of BHCPF funds by anyone in the chain, from Federal, State, LGA, and facilities.\n\nOur Ministerial oversight team will monitor and investigate credible reports, ensuring proper use of resources for primary care services.\n\nWe also urge relevant institutions such as the EFCC, @officialEFCC, ICPC, @icpcnigeria, and DSS @OfficialDSSNG, to keep a close eye and alert us in a preventative way if they receive credible information on any potential misuse of public funds.\n\nMaintaining the integrity of the fiduciary system for PHC financing is a collective responsibility. Transparency is crucial, and all stakeholders must work together to combat corruption in our primary healthcare system.\n\nAs Nigeria embarks on this healthcare transformation, collaboration is essential.\n\nOn winding down the Holy Month of Ramadan and in this Lenten period, we join all in prayers for Nigeria to emerge from its current position and rise again, as envisioned in Mr. President’s Renewed Hope Agenda.\n\nWe also invite all Nigerians and friends of Nigeria to join us in praying for President Tinubu’s strength, protection, and wisdom on his 72nd birthday. \n\n𝑯𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒚 𝑩𝒊𝒓𝒕𝒉𝒅𝒂𝒚 𝒕𝒐 𝒂𝒏 𝒊𝒏𝒔𝒑𝒊𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒂𝒍 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒅𝒆𝒓!",

    "text": "On behalf of the Global and Nigeria’s Stop TB Partnership, I extend heartfelt congratulations to Her Excellency, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, CON, @SenRemiTinubu, the First Lady of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on her investiture as the Global and National Stop TB Champion, @StopTB.\n\nThis momentous appointment marks a significant milestone in Nigeria’s ongoing battle against tuberculosis—a disease that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable in our society, including the socially excluded, the impoverished, and those suffering from malnutrition, HIV, and other comorbidities.\n\nWe are deeply grateful for Her Excellency’s willingness to lead this critical campaign. Her dedication to public health is evident in her immediate and affirmative response to championing this cause, aligning with her Renewed Hope Agenda Initiative and President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s @officialABAT, vision of empowering our nation.\n\nWe recognize the essential roles of religious and traditional leaders, civil society, and the private sector in combating tuberculosis. This whole-of-society approach echoes the sector-wide strategy introduced by President Tinubu in December 2023, aimed at fostering coordinated efforts across all sectors to improve outcomes for our population.\n\nIn line with the National Health Sector Renewal Investment Program, #NHSRIP, we are intensifying investments in primary healthcare, a key component in expanding the scope of services, including tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment. We are poised to announce significant investments in Primary Health Care Centers @NphcdaNG under the Basic Health Care Provision Fund #BHCPF program, incorporating tuberculosis services as an integral part of healthcare accessible to Nigerians. Additionally, in line with the President’s directive, we are unlocking the healthcare value chain, aiming to localize the production of pharmaceuticals and diagnostic kits.\n\nWe have expanded TB treatment services and increased the availability of GeneXpert equipment to 512 as of the end of 2023. We are also enhancing our use of digital X-ray with artificial intelligence for TB screening, with the aim to add 350 digital X-ray machines before the end of June 2024, supported by our funding partners. Furthermore, we have instituted a robust specimen referral network utilizing a hub-and-spoke model, responsible for the transport of over 2.4 million samples in 2023 for TB tests.\n\nInspired by the visionary leadership of President Tinubu, we are committed to ensuring that Nigeria’s efforts in ending tuberculosis not only benefit our nation but also contribute positively to the global community. As a member of the Board of the Global Stop TB Partnership, and in my newly elected role in the Global Fund Board representing West and Central Africa from May 2024, I pledge to bridge the President’s domestic initiatives with the complementary support of our external and bilateral partners.\n\nThe collaboration of our State Governors, @NGFSecretariat, will be essential to amplify their investments in healthcare, particularly in the fight against TB. With the support of the First Lady, we are confident that States will be more equipped to allocate resources towards this critical health issue. I also extend gratitude to my colleague Dr. Tunji Alausa @DrTunjiAlausa, Minister of State for Health, and all public health colleagues for their relentless dedication, which has been instrumental in Nigeria’s achievements thus far.\n\nWe are grateful for the smart collaborations and contributions of our funding and technical partners, including the @GlobalFund and the @CDCgov, United States, the Stop TB Secretariat @LucicaDitiu, as well as the Nigeria Stop TB program. Without their partnership, we’d not have come this far in our efforts.\n\nEspecially, I would like to recognize Mayowa Joel, @mayowajoel, the Executive Secretary @StopTBNigeria, for his unwavering efforts and for being a steadfast champion in this cause for over a decade.",

    "text": "The expected outcomes of our Health Sector Renewal Investment Program were carefully benchmarked on disability-adjusted life years (DALY) indicators, considering the rising percentage of vulnerable and physically challenged groups among Nigeria’s population.\n\nThe program aligns with Nigeria’s ratification and commitment to implementing the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which guarantees the rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons with disabilities to respect and dignity in accessing quality healthcare. The Convention underpins a key pillar of Mr. President’s, @officialABAT, Renewed Hope Agenda to provide equitable and quality healthcare for all Nigerians as a matter of right and urgency.\n\nOn Tuesday, we inaugurated the Steering Committee for the Disability Inclusive Health Initiative, highlighting the barriers faced by people with disabilities when accessing healthcare in Nigeria. \n\nWith about 15-20% of our population living with disabilities, we aim to ensure that our efforts to provide an efficient, equitable, and quality health system do not leave out any citizen of our country.\n\nThe Committee will provide actionable recommendations on how we can better support persons living with disabilities by enforcing anti-discrimination laws and ensuring the rights of people with disabilities, especially as they pertain to healthcare, are upheld. \n\nWe value the insights from the SSA to the President on Disability, @AimohT, and other partners like the Missing Billions Initiative, @_missingbillion, and @McKforSociety. Their recommendation for a cross-ministerial approach to enhance healthcare access, provide assistive technologies, and implement rapid diagnostic services are crucial for supporting PWDs and other marginalized groups.\n\nWe also commend the ongoing efforts by @Fmohnigeria, @NphcdaNG, @NhisNg, the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development @fmha_pa, @NcpwdOfficial and other government agencies to improve access to quality care, health insurance, and social welfare services.\n\nOur shared commitment to promoting effective policies and boosting investments in targeted programs will address physical infrastructure challenges, eliminate communication barriers, and break down stereotypes that hinder PWDs’ access to quality healthcare and social welfare services.",

    "text": "The Federal Ministry of Health & Social Welfare (@Fmohnigeria) is committed to its strategic objective of improving population health outcomes in Nigeria, with a special focus on enhancing access to high-quality oncology care. This is a crucial part of our comprehensive Health Sector Renewal Investment Program, which also targets reproductive, maternal, child, and adolescent health among others.\n\nWith the rising incidence of non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, etc, causing significant physical and financial burdens on Nigerians, the FMOH launched the Oncology Initiative in 2021. This initiative seeks to strengthen cancer care through targeted medical investments, including the establishment of nuclear medicine centers, upgrade of existing facilities, and the deployment of modern medical infrastructure in select tertiary hospitals. \n\nDespite initial implementation delays, there has been a Renewed Hope for this initiative under the leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT. Early in his administration, Mr President tasked us with accelerating collaborations with relevant ministries and agencies for its successful realization.\n\nA significant milestone was achieved this Friday with the signing of a Partnership Agreement with the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (@nsia_nigeria). The agreement aims to provide project management and advisory services to ensure the seamless implementation of the Oncology Initiative. In support of this endeavor, President Tinubu has allocated N37.4 billion to the FMOH Oncology Initiative, demonstrating the government’s commitment to rapid and effective implementation.\n\nTo ensure equitable access to oncology care across the nation, six teaching hospitals have been selected for the initiative, covering all geopolitical zones:\n\nhttps://t.co/Nbmeh64ngI of Benin Teaching Hospital (@ubthng)\n2.Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (@abuthshika)\n3.Federal Teaching Hospital Katsina (@Official_fthk)\nhttps://t.co/EiP2wFiHJ3 of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (@officialunth)\n5.Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH)\n6.Lagos University Teaching Hospital (@LUTHofficial)\n\nThese institutions will be equipped with advanced medical infrastructure, including linear accelerators, iridium brachytherapy machines, computed tomography (CT) simulators, positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, and cyclotrons. The goal is to ensure precise diagnosis and effective management of oncology cases, thereby alleviating the physical and financial strains faced by Nigerians.\n\nThe milestone we’ve reached through the agreement is a testament to what is possible with the right governance and bold leadership, as exemplified by President Tinubu. And we’re quite confident that with a people-oriented approach, no challenge is too great to overcome in our journey.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the agreement will be reviewed and endorsed by NSIA’s Governing Board. We will collaborate with the Standards Organization of Nigeria (@SONNigeria) and the Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority (@NNRA_Official) for effective monitoring and implementation. To ensure transparency, CSOs, media, and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (@officialEFCC) will be critical in monitoring spending and preventing misappropriation of funds. Also, plans are in place to set up a central oversight committee comprising of specialists to oversee project implementation and fund flows, thereby ensuring proper use of resources.\n\nOur target is to complete the construction of the six oncology centers with the appropriate equipment, staffing, training programs, and regulatory frameworks within the next 18-24 months.\n\nWe call upon the goodwill and collaboration of all Nigerians and agencies to ensure transparent operation and delivery of targeted value to our people. The interests of the Nigerian people must remain paramount as we strive to fulfill the goals of the Oncology Initiative for the betterment of our nation and in service to God and country.",

The call for the @_AfricanUnion and @EU_Commission to unify their voices at international policy levels and within Global Health Initiatives to support local regional manufacturing is key for public health and health security. It also aligns with our initiative to unlock the healthcare value chain. \n\nWe wholeheartedly endorse the message from my brother, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros), emphasizing the importance of learning from the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is crucial to break the cycle of panic and neglect, as the threat of pandemics is ever-present, and it is not a question of if, but when the next pandemic will occur. In light of this, we urge all parties to make sincere efforts to achieve a fair Pandemic Accord and to revise the International Health Regulations to better prepare for future global health challenges.\n\nWe welcome the emphasis on Primary Health Care as the most inclusive, effective, and efficient approach to enhancing people’s physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and social well-being through a well sustained Human Resources for Health.\n\nAs the AU Champion for Human Resources for Health and Community Health Delivery Partnership, His Excellency President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT has authorized a unified approach to ensure that Nigeria, and indeed Africa, can boast of a well-trained, remunerated health workforce, including a recognized community health workforce.\n\nI also appreciate France’s Minister of Health Hon Dr. Chrysoula Zacharopoulou @CZacharopoulou for her willingness to explore important collaborations between Nigeria and France in the global health arena.",

Firstly, we are engaging with Nigerian private sector players; and secondly, we are attracting foreign investors and partners. Our consistent message has been that “Investing in the Nigerian pharmaceutical and medical sectors is smart business.” And we are witnessing promising results across the board.\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony, today, for the Phase 2 of the Nigerian AMA Medical Manufacturing Plant in Kaduna State, which I had the honor of conducting alongside Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala @NOIweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organization @wto, was a clear lead. \n\nWe were particularly impressed with the state-of-the-art production plant for high-quality intravenous solutions (IV fluids) at affordable costs, which utilizes European technology, including the Automatic Form Fill Seal (AFFS) Technology. Proudly, the facility is on par with what is available in advanced economies.\n\nThe successful establishment of the AMA Medical Manufacturing Plant and its world-class facilities reaffirm our belief in the power of innovation and resilience, as well as the boundless possibilities that lie ahead for our country. \n\nAMA Medicals has set a benchmark, demonstrating to potential investors that Nigeria is a viable and attractive destination for investment.\n\nI extend my congratulations to Alhaji Musa Bello, Chairman of AMA Medical Manufacturing Plant, and the team of experts who have made this initiative a reality.\n\nAs part of our unwavering commitment to saving lives and improving health outcomes for all Nigerians, we are dedicated to providing an enabling regulatory framework (@NafdacAgency) and appropriate incentives to enhance economies of scale for both national and foreign businesses, in line with the President’s agenda. \n\nNigeria, with a market of 240 million people, and as a gateway to the regional market, is open for business; and we welcome all serious investors.",

These services include access to food, clean water, shelter, vaccines, protection from malaria, treatment, and prenatal and antenatal care, among others.\n\nOur goal to save lives, reduce financial and physical burdens, and provide health for all Nigerians is to be achieved by addressing these needs, using a sector-wide approach with primary healthcare as foundation.\n\nWe recognize that the federal government cannot, by itself alone, provide all the solutions to the country's healthcare and social welfare challenges. Indeed, the Sector-Wide Approach and Compact under the Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative envisions a whole-of-society engagement model. This includes non-state actors such as leaders of Faith-Based Organizations (#FBOs), Traditional Institutions, and other Civil Society Organizations.\n\nOur experience in eliminating the wild poliovirus from Nigeria is a testament to the moral authority, trust, credibility, and convening power of these leaders in their communities and among their followers. Therefore, we regard FBOs and Traditional Institutions as faithful partners in successfully implementing our agenda to improve health outcomes for our people.\n\nToday's meetings with the leadership and members of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria, @CBCN_NG; and also separately with Her Regal Majesty, Amb. Dr. Olori Temitope Enitan Ogunwusi, @herregalmajesty, Southwest Malaria Advocate for the National Malaria Elimination Programme, have reinforced our confidence in this people-centered endeavor.\n\nWe understand the immense contributions of FBOs in providing equitable and non-discriminatory healthcare services, critical role in bridging the gap in accessing essential care and prevention. This is delivered within supportive traditional institutional setting, communities, where our Emirs, Obas, Obis, Oonies, Igwes, and other Royal leaders inspire and lead their people to embrace various primary healthcare campaigns and routine services.\n\nWe express our gratitude to Rev. Fr. Uchechukwu Obodoechina, PhD, for leading the visit and for faithfully representing the goodwill and support offered by the CBCN to the @Fmohnigeria. We deeply appreciate the sacrifices, commitments, and dedication of Caritas Nigeria @CCFNigeria, in promoting good population health outcomes in the country and reaching the last mile of caregiving. We also appreciate the efforts of Her Regal Majesty, Amb. Dr. Olori Ogunwusi, as a lead advocate in south west, towards the elimination of malaria. Your work is critical to solving an age-long challenge of malaria burden.\n\nMr. President, @officialABAT,  has approved the establishment of a Social Action Fund, which will be designed and launched soon, channeled to communities to empower them to live healthier and better lives.\n\nWe are looking forward to the first National Consultative Forum on health, human and social capital, soon, where we will engage with, listen to, our Royal Fathers and Mothers, FBOs and Non-Governmental entities,  on how we can better deploy available resources for health to the benefit of all Nigerians. We are grateful to know that you support Mr President’s direction.",

President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR @officialABAT, is committed to improving the health and wellbeing of Nigerian women and the girl-child to empower them to prosper and thrive. \n\nThis is in line with the theme of #IWD2024 to promote investments in women and accelerate progress against gender-based factors that disempower and exclude women from prosperity and healthy living. \n\nTherefore, the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Programme [#NHSRIP] is designed with a full gender lens and is already delivering the following: \n\n1. Increase access to essential healthcare services for women and girls through the prioritization of primary healthcare revitalization.\n\n2. Over 550,000 attend their first Antenatal Care (ANC) appointments, ensuring they receive the necessary information and care to improve pregnancy outcomes and reduce maternal and child mortality.\n\n3. Enrollment of about 750,000 more Nigerians in health insurance, through the VGF at @NhisNg, providing them with financial protection.\n\n4. Successful high coverage of #HPV vaccination for eligible girls aged 9-14 years, in 15 States, protecting them against cervical cancer.\n\n5. Planned Targeted investments in infrastructure and capacity building in federal tertiary hospitals, enhancing healthcare services for women with complex health conditions, including the North East Vesico-Vaginal Fistula Hospital in Ningi.\n\n6. Commitment to advancing healthcare data management and developing policies on cosmetics safety and food safety, safeguarding the health and well-being of women and girls.\n\n7. Support for medical industrialization initiatives, unlocking opportunities for women's empowerment and economic participation in the healthcare sector.\n\n8. Today, we add our strong voice and take a stand against economic disempowerment, social exclusion, female genital mutilation, gender-based violence and all forms of abuse or discrimination against women and girls. \n\nAnd we are not stopping there. The whole programme we are implementing, under the NHSRIP, for improving population health outcomes has Nigerian women and girls at front and center of our interventions.\n\nHappy International Women’s Day. #IWD2024",

    "text": "The success of the President's @officialABAT Renewed Hope Agenda for improved health outcomes largely depends on the impact made at the community level. For this, we rely on a versatile, well-aligned, and efficient primary healthcare system, through the agency of State Commissioners of Health, to ensure that the policies and resources we are deploying work for the wellbeing of all Nigerians.\n\nThe Compact with State Governors and development partners, under the Health Sector Renewal Investment Program, mandates the State Commissioners of Health to drive the SWAp at the national level and ensure alignment of resources and programs under our One Plan, One Budget, and One Report framework.\n\nMy conversation today with the State Commissioners of Health at the Quarterly Collaborative Meeting of the National Health Commissioner’s Forum (NHCF), organized by the NPHCDA, the fifth time since September, underscored the important place of the States in delivering on the President's mandate to us and our development partners. It was also another good opportunity to appreciate their synergy with us in animating the health sector renewal agenda through the SWAp at the States’ level.\n\n𝐖𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐩 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐝 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐨𝐟 𝐍𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐚 𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐝𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦. Indeed, we have a very complex system involving the Federal Government, States, Private Sector, Civil Society, and of course, the citizens of this country on whose behalf we must deliver; and solutions to the challenges don’t come in a straight line. \n\nTherefore, we have embraced an adaptive framework, which is the philosophy that informs the SWAp, as the lever to drive our agenda. And with the strong leadership and generous support of the President, we have all we need to succeed. We count on you, Honourable Commissioners, to remain the agents of this change as always, while also assuring you of our support to navigate the contextual peculiarities in your individual States.\n\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬 and the governing document to steer the full implementation of the National Act 2014 in a well-coordinated manner to produce improved quality health outcomes for all Nigerians. And we have adequate resources to start. We are deploying more funds now than in the past 10 years, cumulatively, and have good prospects to raise more. Soon we will release N50 billion as the first tranche of the Basic Healthcare Fund, a significant increase from the N25 billion allocated in 2022.\n\nThe role of States, through the Commissioners, as co-creators of the content of the Program and partners in the technical process, remains critical for alignment, transparency, and accountability for the time-bound deployment of the resources and achieving the outcomes. \n\nAt the end of the day, we want to look back at this moment and beat our chests that we have all worked assiduously, as One Team, to deliver an efficient, equitable, and quality health system for the benefit of all Nigerians.",

We must utilize newer evidence-based tools, quality data systems, strengthen our collaborations and partnerships,  develop smarter financing models and new procurement modalities to suit our realities in Nigeria as well the African continent. \n\nThe Sector-Wide approach we have adopted to improve governance, converge resources, align efforts, and amplify impact of health outcomes will lead to success in this regard.\n\nOur meeting with teams from the Malaria Alliance, RBM Malaria Partnership, and @WHO Global Malaria Program partners was to reassess our efforts and mobilize technical and financial resources towards eliminating the scourge of malaria. \n\nWe are jointly considering initiatives, including development of domestic manufacturing of insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs), generic pharmaceuticals, introduction of appropriate, safe and cost effective vaccines, and potentially mosquito-repellent products, anchored on the Presidential Initiative to Unlock Health Sector Value Chain, to eradicate malaria from the country. \n\nThis also requires strengthening our primary healthcare system for malaria testing and early treatment, especially for children,  antenatal mothers, and others. \n\nMr President @officialABAT, as the “African Union @_AfricanUnion Champion for Human Resources for Health and Community Health Delivery”, is strongly supporting us to retrain 120,000 frontline health workers; and to double the number of functional primary health centers in the country from 8,800 to over 17,000 over the next three years, as part of the Health Sector Renewal Investment Program and accompanying sector-wide Compact.\n\nThank you, Ms. Joy Phumaphi @JoyPhumaphi_ , Executive Secretary, 𝐀𝐟𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐌𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚 𝐀𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞, (Malaria Alliance), Dr. Michael Adekunle Charles @DekunleCharles, CEO, RBM Partnership @endmalaria, and 𝐃𝐫 𝐃𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐞𝐥 𝐍𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐣𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢, Director, 𝐆𝐥𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐥 𝐌𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐞, for your leadership, strong advocacy, and championing the fight against malaria.\n\nThere’s a tide in the affairs of every nation which seized at the crest leads to saving millions of lives and offers good returns on development investments. Nigeria’s health sector is at such a crucial moment now; and we have the requisite political will in our President, ample human health resource, willing coalition of partners, and tools to ride this tide and we will.",

As part of our Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative, we are adopting an inter-ministerial and multidisciplinary approach to dismantle gender barriers, promote social welfare and improve access to efficient, equitable and improved quality outcomes across public and private healthcare systems.\n\nToday, we met with the Hon Minister of Women Affairs, Barrister Uju Kennedy-Ohanenye @BarrUjuKennedy @FMWA_ng to discuss how our two ministries could work together, alongside our colleagues and partners, to promote policies on gender related issues for the development, better participation and contribution of women to nation building.\n\nThank you, Hon Minister, for your visit and the pertinent issues we raised. We would continue working together to advance women empowerment and ensure that the best interest of the Nigerian child is prioritized in all our social welfare and health initiatives. Indeed, the “life course approach” we are taking to promote reproductive, maternal, newborn, children and adolescents health recognizes the intersectionality of education, environment, WASH and Nutrition in the wellbeing of all Nigerian families. \n\nI am confident that the systems we are putting in place, backed with the strong political will of Mr President @officialABAT, will serve to empower more women and catalyze the full development of the Nigerian child in our journey towards a healthy and prosperous nation for all.",

This helped in unlocking huge potentials and securing essential diagnostics, vaccines and pharmaceuticals for Brazil’s needs in crisis situations. Similar to Nigeria, Brazil has a large population.\n\nWe were also interested to understand the partnership model underpinning the long-standing collaboration between Bio-Manguinhos / Fiocruz and the Chembio Diagnostics Inc / Biosynex Group @ChembioDx, which specializes in the design and distribution of rapid tests for point-of-care diagnostics at scale.\n\nIn November 2023, the Chembio Diagnostics Inc / Biosynex Group  France expressed intent to establish a local manufacturing outfit in Nigeria, enabling transfer of knowledge how, building Nigerian talent, creating economic value and safeguarding our health security in crisis times.\n\nWe were also glad with the outcome of our discussion with FPG Brands, a São Paulo Brazil-based  investment holding company, committing to invest US $240 million in Nigeria’s health value chain within the next 2 years.  This contrasts with the narrative that some may wish on us, that investors are leaving. Serious investors who see the ultimate promise of Nigeria’s renewal/renaissance  are betting on our optimistic future, in the long run. Thank you FPG for the confidence to come in. \n\nInsightful exchanges and facility tour with the team of Bio-Manguinhos / Fiocruz, highlighting more than a century old legacy journey with the establishment of Oswaldo Cruz Foundation @fiocruz in 1900, speak to how science can promote and improve population health outcomes in a complex, diverse country like Brazil, which is similar to Nigeria. \n\nIt also renews our hope that with a determined political leadership, such as we have in President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT, we will overcome.\n\nWe would like thank the team of Bio-Manguinhos / Fiocruz including Cristiani Machado, Vice-President of Education, Information and Communication; Antonio Ferreira, IVD Reagents Director; Erica Kastrup, International Advisor ; Akira Homma, Senior Scientific Advisor, Rafael Alexandrino Macedo, IVD Reagents Department; Patrícia Alvarez, Molecular Diagnostics Specialist and others.\n\nAlso, we appreciate the helpful facilitation and warm reception by Javan Esfandiari, President Chembio Diagnostics Inc, and his team, as well as Mr. Mohammed Asibelua; Mr. Juan Cubides; Mr. Silvio Junior, and the rest of FPG Brands team.\n\nWe are glad about all your readiness to partner with us. \n\nThe bow has been drawn aimed at unleashing Nigeria’s heath sector value chain and there’s no going back.",

Nigeria’s progress points to what is possible when we align resources and strongly commit to equitably addressing the common issues of social justice and social welfare for the most vulnerable demographic. \n\nIt is imperative that our campaigns become more people-centered, even as we reimagine our tools and strategically align resources, within the context of the evolving Global Health architecture.\n\nIt was good to see Dr. Budi Gunadi Sadikin @BudiGSadikin, Hon Minister of Health, Indonesia; Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, @DrTedros, DG, @WHO; Sir Jeremy James Farrar @JeremyFarrar, Chief Scientist, WHO; Philippe Duneton @DrDuneton Executive Director @UNITAID; and many other colleagues who have, over time, dedicated their career to the common public health good. \n\nThank you, Seth Berkeley @DrSethBerkley, former CEO, @gavi, for your friendship and kind reassurance that we can count on your support and invaluable advice as forge ahead with our health sector renewal agenda. \n\nThe remarkable energy and leadership of Lucica Ditiu @LucicaDitiu, the Executive Director, Stop TB Partnership, remain pivotal for the work at hand. Your team did an excellent job in Brasilia; and we look forward to receiving you all in Abuja in December 2024 at the 38th Stop TB Board Meeting in Nigeria.\n\nWith our continuing efforts, commitment, and aligned collaboration, a world free of TB is within reach for humanity.",

With over 150,000 Nigerian babies being born each year with sickle cell anaemia, the amazing work at the Centre is helping to prevent infant and childhood mortality through access to proper diagnosis and care. \n\nAlso I had the opportunity to inspect the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre (NLCC), which is a Joint Venture between the @nsia_nigeria Healthcare Development Investment Company (‘NHDIC’) and the Lagos University Teaching Hospital to treat and provide care for cancer patients. The high quality medical infrastructure deployed at the Centre has been very helpful in filling existing gaps in tackling the incidence and burden of this disease since 2019. By its operations, it is also catalyzing key socio-economic outcomes including job creation, foreign exchange preservation, by reducing medical tourism on account of cancer, and capacity enhancement in radiation treatment for key medical personnel.\n\nThe visit provided me with a good opportunity to interact with the professionals and health workers as well as some resident doctors. LUTH. The issue of inadequate Human Health Resource is a major hindrance to our target of delivering improved quality healthcare services for our people; but we are poised to address this challenge as part of the Health Sector Renewal Initiative. \n\nIt was very inspiring to engage with and listen to few health officers at LUTH on why they have not succumbed to the japa syndrome. The heart-touching confession of 𝐃𝐫. '𝐌𝐮𝐲𝐢𝐰𝐚 𝐊𝐚𝐲𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐑𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢, the Consultant Anesthetist / Intensivist and Director, ICU on why he has chosen to stay, and the manifest compassion among his colleagues revalidate my faith and hope for a better Nigeria.

It’s been said that somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. Nigeria is going through clear challenges, both in the health sector and other areas, but we will turn the tide. This is what Mr President’s @officialABAT has promised under the Renewed Hope Agenda; and we believe that we have the talents and resources needed, as a country, to achieve our goals and, by the grace of God, we will succeed.",

As a wholly Nigerian-owned enterprise, it underscores the bold ingenuity, and ample resourcefulness of our private sector. \n\nWith non-communicable diseases (#NCDs), including the rising burden of diabetes, projected to make up to 20-25% of Nigeria’s disease burden by 2030, we are determined to promote policies and programs that would help reduce the financial pains faced by our people in accessing timely diagnosis and treatment. \n\nColexa Biosensor’s potential to scale up production from the current capacity of 3.6 million packs per annum to 10.8 million, way above local needs, also presents opportunity for export as well as other economic benefits for Nigeria, including job creation along the value chain. \n\nThe Government of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT, as part of initiatives to attract private sector collaboration, is committed to unlock new investments to the nation’s healthcare-delivery space,  restructuring the cycle of health product manufacturing in favor of African and Nigerian markets, to protect health, create jobs and economic value.\n\nA critical component of FG’s Compact with State Governors, partners and other stakeholders, is to provide effective governance, particularly supportive regulatory framework towards building an efficient, equitable and quality health system for the people of Nigeria.\n\nTogether we can translate Mr. President’s vision into reality as part of the #RenewedHope Agenda.",

This presented another opportunity to appreciate the immense contributions of our Royal Fathers. \n\nAchieving the ambitious targets to reach the most marginalised communities in Nigeria, by strengthening primary healthcare system, (re)training frontline health workers, improving reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health, scaling up financing and using innovation reach every child with immunisation / vaccination services, largely depend on community ownership, engagement, and the support of traditional and religious leaders.\n\nAs Nigeria’s Health Sector Renewal Compact was signed with the State Governors and development partners last week, His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, @officialABAT,  announced that “health is back on the front burner of Nigeria’s national development priorities.” This is one of the kernels of the Renewed Hope Agenda, through which Mr President wants to use improved health outcomes to unify the nation and optimize Nigeria’s potential demographic dividend.\n\nThe unique position of influence of traditional and religious leaders in their domains and their role in healthcare service delivery have far-reaching impacts. And their ability to shape perceptions, dispel myths and mobilize communities is matchless. Hence we partner with them to domesticate the health sector development approach within the Nigerian context.\n\nWe thank His Éminence and all Highnesses for the reiteration of their 100% support to working to deliver on the strategic goals we have set under the Nigeria’s Health Sector Renewal Initiative.\n\nGoing forward we are expanding this approach of engagement with traditional and religious leaders in other parts of the country outside the 19 States, in the national drive, complementing also the role of organized civil society, towards a people-centered health system, in line with our leader, President Tinubu’s vision.",

    "text": "Text of my remarks at the Commemoration of the #UHCDay and Unveiling of the Nigeria Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative by HE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR.\n\nLet me use this occasion to express our profound appreciation to HE President Ahmed Bola Tinubu, GCFR @officialABAT for his incredible and visionary leadership, placing the health and social well-being of Nigerians as a key part of his administration's Renewed Hope Agenda.\n\nMr President, our explications that, good health is core to harnessing Nigeria's greatest asset, its human capital, is at the heart of our relentless efforts to ensure that all Nigerians are on path to have access to improved quality health services and without financial hardship.\n\nThe significantly increased allocation of federal government's budget tc health and social sectors in the proposed 2024 appropriation, demonstrates your unprecedented political will, and certainly go a long way in starting to address the financial gaps that have so far limited Nigeria from achievin g an efficient, equitable and quality health system.\n\nOur Strategic blueprint, to \"save lives, redace both physical and financial pain and produce heulth for all Nigerians \" is anchored around Nigeria's progress towards Universal Health Coverage. To improve population health outcomes, we need access to affordable and quality health services for all Nigerians.\n\nThe Health Sector Renewal we are launching today, is a bold effort, a historic window of opporfunity, and a call to action, to reform and implement the National Health System as provided for in the National Health Act.\n\nThe Sector-Wide Compact is based on our collective recognition that, health is one of the keys to human capital accumulation; and a healthy, economically productive population, growing at a sustainable pace, supported by a health system that caters for all, is essential to Nigeria's socioeconomic development.\n\nBy signing the Compact today, we are agreeing to align our objectives with the priorities articulated in the Renewed Hope Health Sector Blueprint's pillars to improve governance, accountabillty to our citizens, focus on reversing high maternal, newborn, and child diseases and deaths, unlocking the health care value chain through State-directed medical industrialization in partnership with the private sector, and enhancing Nigeria's resilience and health security.\n\nSpecifically, we are redesigning the Basic Health Care Provision Fund #BHCPF, comprising at least I% of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, provided by the National Health Act (2014), as the foundational basis of the sector-wide approach, to:\na. Ensure more equitable, allocation of resources to the poorest and most disadvantaged populations.\nb. Mobilize additional development partner (multilateral, bilateral, philanthropic, and private sector) financial resources to a common pool or aligned in parallel with the sector-wide approach.\n c. Specifically, we expect at least $2.5 billion in pooled and non-pooled financing in the period 2024-2026, to be mobilized and channeled to improve our primary health system and achieve results.\n\nWe expect to double the number of fully functional Primary Healthcare Centers (#PHCs) receiving Decentralized Facility Financing for infrastructural upgrades, and operational costs to ensure delivery of high quality essential Primary Health Care package. Starting by making the existing 8,809 fully functional and gradually increase to 17,618 PHCs by 2027 in all 36 States and the FCT.\n\nWe will prioritize \"best-buy\" investments in community health models, to serve as a critical entry point to public health services in a people-centered health system. As a first step, we are retraining of up to 120,000 frontline health workers as collaborative effort between Federal, State Governments, and key development paftners to be followed by enhanced deployment of those frontline health workers.",

    "text": "This investigative reporting by @daily_trust reveals the depth of depravity and criminality prevalent in sections of our society. We Acknowledge and feel the pain experienced by those affected by such ignoble acts of criminality.\n\nTo be clear, there is a sound policy and legal framework that enables regulation of health practice in Nigeria, including medically necessary transplantation. \n\nThe NHA (2014) sections 51-56 clearly prohibits the illegality uncovered by the journalists. The central issues are on the enforcement practices and evasion of such legal and regulatory guidelines by unpatriotic criminal elements. This is similar in some ways to many other acts of criminality in society.\n\nTo enhance effectiveness of government in regulating practices, in line with the renewed hope agenda, the @Fmohnigeria inaugurated the Tertiary Hospitals Care Standards Committee 4 weeks ago and is making it functional. In the proposed 2024 appropriation directed by @officialABAT  we slated significant resources to enhance such regulations and curb the criminality experienced by Nigerians over so many years in the past. \n\nThe MDCN is also gearing up to enforce standards to be followed by medical professionals in Nigeria. However, regulation of hospitals relies on State Governments, whom we expect will also step up to ensure such facilities in their domains, as found by the journalists, are properly checked.\n\nWe appreciate journalists conducting their work, unbiased and without sensationalism. At the end of the day, it is all of us, as Nigerian people that will make this country better. In our Ministry @DrTunjiAlausa and I, along with all our colleagues, are committed to improving our effectiveness and efficiency in the exercise of the mandate granted by Mr President.",

Further endorsed at the 64th NCH recently. \n\nThe SWAp we have jointly designed is pragmatic, adaptive, and suitable to Nigeria’s health needs. And highlights our plan to use the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund #BHCPF as a basis for reviving the primary health care system in addition to other financing mechanisms.  \n\nThe task ahead is huge but surmountable and we are committed to leading the charge. We will provide the leadership, effective governance and other enabling policy measures to deliver an efficient, equitable and quality primary health system. We also count on your continuing partnerships, working together as One Team, bound by One Plan, towards One Goal, to deliver Renewed Hope for improved health outcomes for all Nigerians.",

This is in addition to the enabling directive to the Ministry to pursue a Sector-Wide Approach in the planning, implementation, and impact assessment of our health sector initiatives.\n\nToday, we were given audience at the Nigerian Senate @NGRSenate for the Joint 2023 Budget Performance and 2024 Budget Defense by the Ministry. We appreciate the Senate Committee on Health and also Primary Health Care, and the House Committee Chairs, for the kind engagement, oversight, and guidance.  \n\nEspecially, I thank the Senate Committee Chairman, Senator Dr. Ipalibo Harry Banigo DSSRS @HarryBanigo, and the Chairman, House Committee on Healthcare Services, Hon. Dennis Idahosa @IdahosaDennis, and all their members, for their leadership and confidence in our unwavering commitment to work towards a healthy and prosperous Nigeria.\n\nThe President has promised Nigerians that he’d transform this country; and health is one of the key elements for realizing this Agenda. \n\nWe are focusing on infrastructure in the frontlines, equipment in our federal tertiary hospitals, and also expanding the primary health care system so that Nigerians everywhere will have access to better quality services. \n\nPooled procurement of quality medicines will reduce burden of rising pharmaceutical prices on the most vulnerable Nigerians. \n\nBy putting the welfare of Nigerians at the center and creating enabling environment for the health workforce, we count on fellow Nigerians patriotism to reduce the exodus abroad. \n\nNigerians are mostly asking for basic healthcare services including drugs, vaccines for their children, and facilities for improving reproductive and maternal health. Also that when they have complicated conditions they’d be able to go to a quality health facility. This includes cancer care and affordable treatment for other non-communicable diseases. \n\nThat is what Mr President wants us to tackle, and by the grace of God, we will work hard to succeed.",

The lack of reliable access to energy in our Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Healthcare Facilities continues to undermine the coverage and quality of basic healthcare and social welfare services delivered to millions of people in the country. \n\nIn addition, the existence of climate-linked humanitarian crises which impact health, as well as climate related outbreaks and public health risks complicate efforts to revamp the healthcare system. Air pollution from traditional cooking  and energy sources are increasingly affecting the health of our people, with a high burden of disease and deaths that could be avoided by transitioning to zero- emission, clean energy sources.\n\nI announced bold initiatives to; \n\n1.Solarize all public tertiary hospitals in the country (in phases) over a 4-year period through the deployment of large scale solar plants and battery energy storage systems.\n\n2.Provide service-specific, clean electrification solutions OR Clean, facility-wide sustainable electrification for thousands of #BHCPF PHCs by 2027 as part of our sector wide approach. \n\n3.  Build climate resiliency for the health system in collaboration with all other sectors; and strengthen surveillance and early warning systems for health threats and climate-linked threats. \n\nThe Government of Nigeria @NigeriaGov, led by HE Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, @officialABAT, is committed to increasing the domestic financing for health including resources to scale up our climate and energy transition interventions for health. We are forging a path to a more sustainable environment, better health and wellbeing for all Nigerians. Strong collaboration with our development partners and friends will be catalytic to achieving these targets. Also, bold leadership, smart and scaled financing, effective governance and accountability will be very critical.",

But remarkably, the unanimous approval by Council members to adopt and implement the Sector-Wide Approach policy for Nigeria’s Health Sector Renewal was resonating. This is in light of what this means for co-creation of programmes and initiatives across the 36 States, FCT, and for resource alignment with our development partners and other stakeholders.   \n\nAlso exciting was adoption of the Memo to commemorate Health Promotion Day in Nigeria for preventive healthcare advocacy and raising awareness about healthy lifestyles. Equally significant was the adoption of the NCD policy towards effective prevention and control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in all 36 States and FCT. Given our aging population dynamics, increased investments in this cohort is catalytic for producing quality health and saving Nigerian lives.\n\nWe thank the staff of FMOH, the Executive Governor of Ekiti State, HE Mr. 'Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji, @biodunaoyebanji, and the good people of Ekiti State, Chief Afe Babalola and Afe Babalola University @Abuad_Uni, and all stakeholders in Nigeria’s health sector, for the keen participation and support in a very productive NCH64. Particularly, I appreciate the State Commissioners of Health led by Dr Banji Filani, @okeanaye, all the development partners, Health Sector Civil Society Organizations, the Media, and a host of others who worked behind the scenes over the period. We are deeply grateful to the Kabiyesi, Oba Rufus Adeyemo Adejugbe Aladesanmi III CON, the Ewi of Ado Ekiti, for his very warm reception, Royal support to the health initiatives and for the extraordinary hospitality. \n\nThe framework to build a resilient and inclusive healthcare system for a healthy Nigeria is now laid out before us. Let us, in the same spirit of partnership, align our resources and commit to strengthening healthcare governance and access; and building a skilled and motivated health human resource for the attainment of universal health coverage for all Nigerians.\n\nI am optimistic that by the time we meet in Borno State for the 65th NCH in 2024, we would look back to the  resolutions adopted by this Council and be happy at how we have come closer to achieving our goals.",

Towards this, Mr President recently created the “Unlocking Healthcare Value-Chain Initiative”.\n\nOur intent is to stimulate private sector led, sustainable, local production of critical health products. \n\nWe have scheduled an invitation-only meeting next week with the key national actors in the industry to follow up and find workable solutions.\n#BHCPF #RenewedHope #UHC",

Nigeria is blessed with world class Human Resources for Health and other God-given resources which we are catalyzing for a reimagined healthcare service delivery.\n\nUnder the visionary leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR @officialABAT, we are  accelerating investments in infrastructure, equipment, human resources, and clinical governance systems to improve the quality of health care available to Nigerians. We will promote the preservice and in-service training of health workers to equip them with necessary capacity and skills to adequately perform the tasks of responding to the health needs and expectations of the population.\n\nThe success recorded in ATBUTH Bauchi also revalidates our goals to provide special medical services as may be needed by Nigerians and reverse the current trend of medical tourism. The hospital now has a full upper tract endoscopic and laser facility that residents and others could access without going abroad. In addition to job creation and economic growth, this would help reduce financial and physical pain and produce efficient and quality health outcomes for our people.\n\nWe salute the leadership of the 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐟 𝐌𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐁𝐚𝐮𝐜𝐡𝐢 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐇𝐨𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥, 𝐃𝐫.

And we are committed to upscaling equipment and other infrastructure in federal medical institutions under our National Health Sector Renewal Investment \n\nWe will be rolling out a redesigned BHCPF (2.0) in a sector-wide approach to help strengthen the facilities, increase standards, and bring equity to our primary healthcare system. At same time we will enhance capacity of our FTHs in 2024 on our way to produce quality healthcare service. It is not going to be easy, but God-willing, we can do it.",

This will strengthen disease surveillance, information sharing and accelerate operationalization of the One Health platform and frameworks at federal and sub-national levels of government.\n\nAchieving health security for all Nigerians means addressing the full spectrum of disease control – from prevention to detection, preparedness, response and management. We must stop outbreaks in their tracks to save Nigerian lives and reduce the financial and physical pains associated with delayed response to epidemics. \n\nWe must also pay attention to the silent but deadly problem of rising anti-microbial resistance, where antibiotics used in livestock agriculture finds ways into human microbiome and contribute to disease. \n\nWe will support the Technical Experts, DG @NCDCgov,  Ifedayo Adetifa, @IfedayoTiffy, as well as others, across sectors, to work together in the spirit of One Health.",

Pivotal to this is giving all Nigerian youth the opportunities they deserve on their path to adulthood. \n\nThe “whole-of- government” / “whole-of-society” path we have embraced in our Strategic Blueprint for saving lives reducing financial and physical pain to produce health for our people is hinged on deploying a sector-wide approach for resource optimization, transparency and accountability.\n\nExperience from #COVID19 response underscored the need for Nigeria and indeed, Africa, to build its own health system resiliency. Core to this is vaccines development as well as other medical consumables along the value chain. Vaccination is indispensable for health security; and remains one of the most significant medical innovations available to humankind. We have leveraged its efficacy globally to drastically increase life expectancy, decrease mortality, and contribute to economic growth. But we have lagged in recognizing the potential for immunisation to lessen the country’s disease burden. \n\nRobust and reliable vaccine capacity in Nigeria and Africa is a global public good, achievable, deserving of global support. It is established that the public market for vaccines in the continent could rise from $1.3 billion today to between $2.3 billion and $5.4 billion by 2030. This is a huge opportunity for Nigeria and the continent to develop our economies, build medical value chains, create jobs, and thrive!\n\nAs the most populous nation and biggest economy in Africa, Nigeria’s leadership and success in this area, leveraging the brilliant minds and resources God has blessed us with, will be critical. This is both for achieving the #AfricaWeWant in line with @_AfricanUnion #Agenda2063 and achieving the #SDG3 by setting off the continent on an unimpeachable trajectory for growth and human development.\n\nThe Government of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT is committed to doing its part to ensure Africa’s health security. As a country, we are setting in motion mechanisms to initiate local production of medical products. \n\nWe are also set to optimize our health spending, upscale pre-service training of health workers, upgrade facilities, and provide basic minimum package of health services to Nigerians through the #BHCPF 2.0 towards the #UHC by 2030. And we count on the support of our development partners and all our friends in this noble journey.\n\nToday, we welcomed Professor Senait Fisseha @DrSenait, Director, Global Programs at Susan Thompson Buffet Foundation @buffett_susan and her team to the Headquarters of Federal Ministry of Health & Social Welfare @Fmohnigeria. We are excited on the alignment of strategic plans for improved quality health outcomes across sectors and targets. We will work together to promote clinical research and development, stimulate local production of health products, shape markets to ensure sustainable local demand, and strengthen supply chains. We are united in our agenda to saving lives and reducing the physical and financial pain of Nigerians through access to quality healthcare.",

I’d like to implore fellow parents and all leaders to dutifully ensure that this generation of our girls disrupt the preventable loss of lives to cervical cancer in addition to other untold hardship, loss, and pain.",
